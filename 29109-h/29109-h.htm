<h2 class="normal">Introduction</h2>

<p>A special interest attaches to this translation into English of D.
Menant&rsquo;s monograph entitled &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Les
Parsis</span>,&rdquo; arising from the circumstance that it is, in
great part, the work of a Parsi lady, the late Miss Ratanbai Ardeshir
Vakil.</p>

<p>I have still a vivid recollection of the morning in the beginning of
the year 1886 on which Mr. Ardeshir F. Vakil, senior partner in one of
the leading firms of solicitors in Bombay, brought his two daughters
Meherbai and Ratanbai to the Wilson College to begin their career as
students of the Bombay University. Although for many years that
University had prefaced its Regulations with the
sentence&mdash;&ldquo;In the following regulations the pronoun
&lsquo;he&rsquo; and its derivatives are used to denote either
sex,&rdquo; and had thus opened its doors wide to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd0e170" href="#xd0e170">x</a>]</span>women of India,
only one lady student had been enrolled as undergraduate in Arts before
these two sisters entered upon their College career. The experiment
which was then made awakened some anxieties. Would it be possible for
Indian ladies to study in a mixed College class? How would the men be
likely to conduct themselves in the new situation?&mdash;these were
questions which naturally presented themselves. The result of the
experiment disappointed from the beginning all such fears. From the
first day the presence of these ladies elevated the tone and discipline
of the College class in a manner most creditable to the ladies and to
the men. The success of this experiment paved the way for the admission
during subsequent years of an increasing number of lady students to the
privileges of a University education, who are under no small obligation
to the courage and character displayed by these two sister pioneers.
They both came to the University under the impulse of a real love of
learning, and their success in the pursuit of it was assured from the
beginning.</p>

<p>In this prefatory note I confine myself to the career of the younger
sister. The elder, after her graduation as Bachelor of Arts in Bombay,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e174" href=
"#xd0e174">xi</a>]</span>entered upon a course of medical study which
led her ultimately to London and Glasgow. From the Glasgow University
she received the degrees of M.B., C.M., and is now exercising her
profession in her native city.</p>

<p>The younger sister, Ratanbai, never left home. The strength of her
attachment to her home in Bombay was quite remarkable. She found little
enjoyment even in those temporary absences from Bombay during the hot
season vacation which prove so attractive to many. Her life moved in
two spheres&mdash;the College and her home, and these two sufficed.</p>

<p>Born in December, 1869, she was a girl of sixteen when she entered
upon her studies for her degree. She passed through the ordinary
curriculum of study, which included English and French Literature,
Mathematics, Elementary Science, History, and Logic. The subjects in
which she was specially interested were English and French Literature.
French was recognised by the University as one of the languages which
might be studied in the course for the degree of Bachelor of Arts when
she entered upon her studies, and she was one of the first to select
this language. She had as her instructor the late Signor Pedraza, a
gentleman whose name <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e180" href=
"#xd0e180">xii</a>]</span>will always be associated with the history of
the progress of French studies in Western India. Under his competent
guidance she acquired a great love for French literature, and found in
this side of her studies much mental enjoyment. In 1890 she passed her
examination for the degree with honours, and was immediately thereafter
elected to a Fellowship in the College. This also was a new and
interesting experiment, amply justified by its results.</p>

<p>As a Dakshina Fellow she taught the French classes in the College,
and had as her pupils not only young ladies but also young men. When
the period of her fellowship expired she continued her connection with
the College and remained in charge of the French classes, performing a
highly-valued service on the merely nominal salary of a Fellow of an
Indian College. She maintained her connection with the College simply
from love to the College and the work. During her College career both
she and her sister had given evidence of their unselfishness by
declining, on more than one occasion, scholarships to which their
position in the University examinations would have entitled them, in
order that poorer students less high in the lists might have the
benefit of the aid and rewards which <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd0e184" href="#xd0e184">xiii</a>]</span>they were willing to forego.
Ratanbai showed the same spirit of generosity during all the years of
her connection with the College, and every student movement that needed
financial aid could always reckon on her liberal help. In the truest
sense her work in the Wilson College was a labour of love.</p>

<p>She continued this work up to the time of that last sad illness
which ended so rapidly in her lamented death. So quickly did she
succumb that I knew of her serious illness only a few hours before she
passed away. I shall not readily forget the grief of her home when the
shadow of death was falling upon it, nor the gloom which entered when
she passed out of it. It was indeed as if all its light and joy had
perished. One could see how the education and culture of women, instead
of creating a cleft in the life of the family, as is so often
erroneously imagined by those who oppose the cause of female education
in India, proves a means of strengthening its unity and elevating its
whole character.</p>

<p>In this respect Ratanbai was exercising an influence greater than
she knew on the prospects of education amongst her countrywomen, by
disarming all such suspicions and by proving <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="xd0e190" href="#xd0e190">xiv</a>]</span>in her own person the
essential compatibility of the higher culture with the best domestic
virtues. She never felt tempted by her love of books to neglect her
duties as a daughter and a sister in the home, or, if she did, she
overcame the temptation completely.</p>

<p>Her influence on College students was of the same quiet, unobtrusive
character, and, for that reason, all the more real. When she died, the
students of the College felt themselves bereaved of a true friend. A
spontaneous movement on their part to found a memorial of her in the
College awakened a general response, and the Ratanbai Collection of
French Works placed in the College Library was the result.</p>

<p>Through the efforts of friends outside the College who admired her
character and attainments, a scholarship fund was raised in her memory,
and the College awards every year scholarships to women students on
this foundation.</p>

<p>During a brief career she was enabled to illustrate by a singularly
modest and unassuming life the power and the lasting influence of
unselfish service. The truest mark of her unselfishness was her own
unconsciousness of it; by look and manner she seemed continually to
deprecate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e198" href=
"#xd0e198">xv</a>]</span>all commendation or praise. Unselfish devotion
to duty in the two spheres of life to which she belonged, her home and
her College, was the outstanding feature of the brief but happy career
which closed so suddenly when Ratanbai passed away in 1895, at the
early age of twenty-six; and because of this her memory remains.</p>

<p>The unfinished manuscript now completed and published will be
welcomed by many who knew and esteemed the writer, as well as by all in
whom the perusal of this volume awakens an interest in the ancient race
to which she belonged.</p>

<h2 class="super">The Parsis</h2>

<h2 class="label">Chapter I</h2>

<h2 class="normal">The Exodus of the Parsis</h2>

<p>The Parsis are the descendants of the ancient Persians, whose fame
has survived in the annals of the world. Reduced henceforth to perhaps
the most restricted minority amongst all the nations of the globe, they
are found dispersed all over the Presidency of Bombay, and in some
districts of modern Persia, in Yezd and in Kirman, where they have been
vegetating for centuries. The Bible,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e225src"
href="#xd0e225">1</a> the classical historians,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e231src" href="#xd0e231">2</a> national traditions,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e234src" href="#xd0e234">3</a> and epigraphical
documents <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href=
"#pb2">2</a>]</span>recently brought to light by European <i>
savants</i><a class="noteref" id="xd0e241src" href="#xd0e241">4</a>
give us some information concerning their history.</p>

<p>Fars represents in our days the little province of <i>Parsua</i>,
which has given its name to one of the greatest civilisations of
antiquity. It is bounded on the west by Susiana, on the north and on
the east by the Deserts of Khavir and Kirman, with a coast-line along
the Persian Gulf between Bushire and Bunder Abbas. In ancient times the
inhabitants, divided into tribes, led a simple, rustic life, superior
in all respects to their neighbours the Medes, already enervated by
civilisation. Between the ages of five and twenty, says Herodotus, the
young Persians are taught three things: to mount the horse, to stretch
the bow, and to speak the truth (Her., <i>Clio</i>, cxxxi.). It was
amongst them, and amongst the Bactrians, that the principles of the
Zoroastrian religion had been maintained in all their purity.</p>

<p>With Cyrus, the descendant of Ach&aelig;menes, the real history of
Persia begins. He founded the dynasty of the Ach&aelig;menides, which
lasted for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href=
"#pb3">3</a>]</span>two centuries, and attained by its conquests a
degree of splendour of which we find unmistakable traces everywhere. It
was at Arbela<a class="noteref" id="xd0e256src" href="#xd0e256">5</a>
(331) that Alexander overthrew Darius, the last prince of this dynasty,
and, on his death, Persia was numbered amongst the countries that had
passed under the subjection of the Seleucid&aelig;. In 225 <span class=
"smallcaps">B.C.</span>, Arsace, of the province of Parthia, revolted
against Antiochus Theos, and laid the foundations of a new empire. The
dynasty of the Arsacides reigned until a Persian prince of somewhat
inferior birth, Ardeshir, founded in his turn a national dynasty, viz.,
that of the Sassanides (226 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span>). The
Romans were its constant enemies. However, the real danger revealed
itself only with the advent of the Arabs, who, approaching nearer and
nearer, had already conquered several provinces when King Yezdezard
made preparations for resistance.</p>

<p>The first invasion took place under Khalif Omar (633).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e270src" href="#xd0e270">6</a> Khalud Ben Walid at the
head of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>ten
thousand men, and Mosanna at the head of eight thousand, had marched
against Hormuz, the Persian Governor of Irak, and had vanquished him.
After this victory Khalud had gone forward and conquered Irak; but he
was defeated at the battle of Marwaha (634). Four thousand Mussulmans
were killed, and two thousand returned to Medina. Unfortunately the
Persian general Behman did not follow up this advantage. The country
was at this time divided into two factions, one under Rustam, the
generalissimo of the Persian Empire, the other under Prince Firoz.
Behman, instead of securing the independence of his country, hastened
to support Rustam against Firoz. The Arabs, emboldened by their rapid
successes, established their camp between Kadesia<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e290src" href="#xd0e290">7</a> and Koufah, where <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>by the Caliph&rsquo;s
order hordes of Nomads came to reinforce their troops. The struggle
lasted for three days and three nights; the Persian army was entirely
destroyed, and the royal standard <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6"
href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>fell into the hands of the Arabs.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e394src" href="#xd0e394">10</a> Yezdezard, informed of
this misfortune, escaped to Holwan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7"
href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>Sa&rsquo;d, having taken possession of Madain,
pursued the fugitive monarch, who withdrew to Rei.</p>

<p>In the twentieth year of the Hejira, Omar recalled Sa&rsquo;d, and
Yezdezard took this opportunity to gather together a hundred and fifty
thousand men, all the contingents having been drawn from the province
of Khorassan and from the environs of Rei and Hamadan. Firouzan was
appointed commander. The Caliph, hearing of the preparations of the
Persian king, sent in his turn reinforcements, and placed at their head
his general No&rsquo;m&acirc;n, with the strictest orders to destroy
the impious religion of the Fire-Worshippers. It was at Nehawend<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e423src" href="#xd0e423">11</a> that, after a
delay of two months, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href=
"#pb8">8</a>]</span>the shock of arms decided the fate of Iran. Thirty
thousand Persians fell on the battlefield, and eighty thousand were
drowned in the moats surrounding the camp. Firouzan was pursued into
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>the
mountains and killed by a detachment of Arabs.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e467src" href="#xd0e467">12</a></p>

<p>From that time Persia passed into the hands of the Caliphs.
Yezdezard escaped at first to Seistan and then to Merv. The governor of
this town offered to deliver up the fugitive prince to the Kh&acirc;n
of Turkestan. The Turks entered the town in spite of the resistance of
the inhabitants, and the king, taking advantage of the confusion,
succeeded in hiding himself in a neighbouring mill. The miller at first
gave protection to the king; but urged by a desire to get possession of
his arms and his clothes, he, like a coward, killed the king. The irate
people massacred the assassin, and the body of Yezdezard, son of
Sheheriar, the last sovereign of the S&aacute;ss&aacute;nian dynasty,
was sent to Istakhr, there to be deposited in the tomb of his ancestors
(<span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span> 650).</p>

<p>The conquest of Persia was accomplished with surprising rapidity.
Shortly after the death of the king, Islamism was imposed upon all; but
certain amongst the Mazdiens offered resistance, and even succeeded in
remaining in their fatherland; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10"
href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>others, unwilling to accept the law of the
Koran, abandoned their hearths, and went and dwelt in the mountainous
districts of Khorassan,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e488src" href=
"#xd0e488">13</a> where, for a hundred years, they were enabled to live
and practise their religion without being disturbed. They were,
however, obliged to quit this asylum and to take refuge in large
numbers in the little island of Hormuz,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e496src" href="#xd0e496">14</a> at the entrance of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>the Persian Gulf.
Here they made but a short sojourn, and finally decided to seek the
protection of the Hindoos. They procured vessels and embarked with
their wives and children.</p>

<p>The relations between Persia and India had been rather frequent, and
it was precisely their former intercourse, rendered closer a few
centuries <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12">12</a>]</span>before the Arab invasion, that made this
migration possible. This we can see from an interesting <i>
r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> given in the <i>Gazetteer of the Bombay
Presidency</i>, p. 247, and which we reproduce here:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In legendary times some religious connection had existed
between the great prophet Zoroaster, who flourished about 1000 <span
class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (see Haug, <i>Essays</i>, 299), and the
Brahman Tchengreghatchah, who was sent back to convert his compatriots.
(See also in Firdusi the story of Prince Isphandiar, son of Gustasp,
who was such a fervent disciple of Zoroaster that he persuaded the
Emperor of India to adopt the worship of fire,&mdash;Elliot, <i>
History</i>, v. 568). The Hindoo tradition of the introduction of
fire-worshipping priests from Persia into Dwarka in Kathyawar is
probably of a much later date (Reinaud, <i lang="fr">M&eacute;moire sur
l&rsquo;Inde</i>, 391&ndash;397). Another link, and this time of an
entirely political nature, is discovered in the mythical conquests of
Northern India, which, according to Persian writers, must have followed
from the year 1729 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> (Troyer, <i>
Rajatarangini</i>, ii. 441). In historical times the Punjaub formed
part of the Persian dominions since its conquest by Darius Hystaspes
(510 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>) down to the end of the <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>dynasty of the
Ach&aelig;menides (350 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>).
(Rawlinson, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1193039"><i>Ancient
Monarchies</i></a>, iv. 433.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Towards the commencement of the Christian era, as is seen
from the fire altars on their coins, the Kanerkis or the Scythians of
India, the rulers of the Punjaub, seem to have adopted the religion of
the Magi (Lassen, in <i>J. B. A. S.</i> ix. 456; Prinsep, <i>Note on
Historic Researches from Bactrian Coins</i>, 106). As far as Southern
India is concerned, the mention of Brahmani Magi in Ptolemy (150) seems
to indicate some relation with Persia, but the Kanarese word <i>mag</i>
or &lsquo;son&rsquo; gives a sufficient explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Closer connection between India and Persia dates from the
restoration of the Persian power under the Sassanide dynasty
(226&ndash;650 <span class="smallcaps">A.D.</span>). In the fifth
century the visit of the Persian prince Behram (436), who had come,
doubtless, to implore aid against the White Huns (Wilson, <i>Ariana
Antiqua</i>, 383), his marriage with a Hindoo princess, and, according
to indigenous accounts, his founding the dynasty of the Ghardabin
kings, made this intimacy closer (Wilford, <i>As. Res.</i> ix. 219;
Masoudi, <i>Prairies d&rsquo;or</i>, ii. 191; Reinaud, <i lang="fr">
M&eacute;moire sur l&rsquo;Inde</i>, 112; Elliot, <i>Hist</i>. ii.
159). Later on Noshirwan the Just (531&ndash;579) and his grandson
Parviz (591&ndash;628) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14">14</a>]</span>allied themselves, by treaties and by the
exchange of rich presents, to the rulers of India and Sindh (Masoudi,
<i lang="fr">Prairies d&rsquo;or</i>, ii. 201). As to these treaties,
it is interesting to notice that the subject of one of the paintings in
the Caves of Ajanta is believed to represent the embassy of Noshirwan
to Pulikesi, king of Badami, in the country south of that of the
Mahrattas, whilst another is supposed to be a copy made after the
portraits of Parviz and the beautiful Shirin (Fergusson, in
Burgess&rsquo; <i>Ajanta Notes</i>, 92). According to certain
narratives, a body of Persians landed, at the commencement of the
seventh century, in Western India, and it is supposed that to one of
these chiefs, regarded by Wilford as a son of Khosroo Parvis, is to be
traced the origin of the Udeipore dynasty (Gladwin, <i>
Ain-i-Akbari</i>, ii. 81; Dr. Hunter, <i>As. Res.</i> vi. 8; Wilford,
<i>As. Res.</i> ix. 233; Prinsep, <i>Jour. Ben. As. Soc.</i> iv. 684).
Wilford considered the Konkanasth Brahmins as belonging to the same
race; but, although their origin is doubtful, the Konkanasths had
settled in India long before the Parsis. Moreover, India and Persia had
been connected by commercial treaties. Cosmas Indicopleustes (545)
found some Persians amongst the principal traders settled along <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>the coasts of
the Indian Ocean (Migne, <i>Patrologi&aelig; Cursus</i>, lxxxviii. 446;
Yule, <i>Cathay</i>, 1, clxxvii.&ndash;clxxix.), and his assertion as
to the existence of a Persian bishop at the head of the Christian
communities of Kalyan (Yule, <i>Cathay</i>, 1, clxxi.), discloses close
relations between Thana and the Persian Gulf. Shortly after the time of
Cosmas, the empire of the seas passed from the Romans to the Persians,
and the fleets of India and China visited the Persian Gulf (Reinaud,
<i>Aboulf&eacute;da</i>, 1&ndash;11, ccclxxxiii.&ndash;iv.). It was
this connection between Western India and Persia which urged, in 638
(H. 16) Caliph Omar (634&ndash;643) to found the city of Bussorah,
partly for the needs of commerce and partly to prevent the Indian
princes from coming to the help of the Persians (Troyer, <i>
Rajatarangini</i>, ii. 449; <i lang="fr">Chronique de Tabari</i>, iii.
401), and, in the same year (638&ndash;639), prompted him to send a
fleet to ravage the coasts of Thana (Elliot, <i>Hist.</i> i. 415).
Tabari (838&ndash;921) and Masoudi (900&ndash;950) both prove that the
district round Bussorah and the country under the subjection of <span
class="corr" id="xd0e649" title="Not in source">the</span> King of Oman
were regarded by the Arabs as forming part of India (<i lang=
"fr">Chronique de Tabari</i>, iii. 401; <i>Prairies d&rsquo;or</i>, iv.
225). In the seventh century it has been noticed that several Indians
had settled in the principal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href=
"#pb16">16</a>]</span>cities of Persia, where they enjoyed the free
exercise of their religion (Reinaud, <i>Aboulf&eacute;da</i>,
1&ndash;11, ccclxxxiv.). It should also be noticed that from the sixth
century, when the Persians commenced taking a leading part in the
commerce and trade of the East, they visited not only India, but China
also (Reinaud, <i>Aboulf&eacute;da</i>, 1&ndash;11, ccclxxxiii.).
Towards the period of their arrival in India, the Parsis were settled
in China as missionaries, merchants, or refugees. Anquetil du Perron
(<i>Zend-Avesta</i>, 1, cccxxxvi.) speaks of Persians going to China,
in the seventh century, with a son of Yezdezard. According to Wilford
(<i>As. Res.</i> ix. 235), another band of emigrants joined them in
750, towards the beginning of the reign of the Abbassides. In 758 the
Arabs and the Persians were so strong in Canton that they stirred up
several riots and plundered the town (Reinaud, <i>Aboulf&eacute;da</i>,
1&ndash;11, ccclxxxv.). In 846 there is a mention made of <i>
Muhapas</i> or <i>Mobeds</i> in Canton (Yule, <i>Cathay</i>, 1, xcvi.),
and sixty years later Masoudi affirms that there were many fire-temples
in China (<i lang="fr">Prairies d&rsquo;or</i>, iv. 86).&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb">
<p>It is scarcely probable that there could have been only one
migration of the Persians. There must have been many such, at different
periods, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href=
"#pb17">17</a>]</span>according as the spirit of persecution was more
or less strong amongst the conquerors. The traditions concerning this
subject are vague. We are in absolute ignorance as to the mode of their
departure, and the number of those who, in despair, had to quit the
Persian Gulf. The only information that we can get at concerning this
subject is that contained in a book entitled <i>Kissah-i-Sanjan</i>,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e696src" href="#xd0e696">15</a> written towards
the year 1600 by a Mazdien priest called Behram Kaikobad Sanjana, who
dwelt in Naosari. According to this author, Diu,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e720src" href="#xd0e720">16</a> a small town on the Gulf of <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>Cambay to the
south of the Kathyawar coast, was the first port where the refugees
landed. Here they dwelt for nearly twenty years, at the end of which
they sought for another residence. There is a mysterious passage in the
<i>Kissah-i-Sanjan</i> upon this second immigration, but it scarcely
explains it. &ldquo;An old Dastoor (high-priest) who had applied
himself to the science of predicting <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb19" href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>from the stars, declared that they
should leave this place and seek another residence. All rejoiced on
hearing these words, and immediately set sail for Gujerat.&rdquo;
Scarcely had they left the coast of Diu when a storm burst upon them,
and the Persians believed themselves hopelessly lost. They then
implored the aid of Him for whom they had abandoned all, promising to
light the sacred fire as soon as they should have touched the shores of
India.</p>

<p>He heard the prayer of his faithful children. The tempest fell, and
they were able to land at Sanjan,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e745src"
href="#xd0e745">17</a> twenty-five miles south of Damman.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e756src" href="#xd0e756">18</a> <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>The territory of Sanjan was,
at that time, subject to the sage Jadi Rana,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e777src" href="#xd0e777">19</a> to whom the Persians sent a
Dastoor, with presents, to obtain permission to settle in his country,
and to inquire what conditions would be imposed upon them. The Dastoor,
approaching the Rana, invoked blessings upon him, and after having
explained to him the reasons that had determined the fugitives to quit
their fatherland, he narrated their misfortunes, and asked for his
countrymen authoritative permission to settle in Sanjan. The prince, it
is said, struck by the warlike and distinguished appearance of these
foreigners, at first conceived some fear, and desired to know something
of their usages and customs. During their sojourn at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>Diu the Persians had
learnt sufficiently well the spirit and character of the Hindoos, to
answer his questions in a satisfactory manner. The most learned amongst
them drew up sixteen <i><span class="corr" id="xd0e792" title="Source:
S&rsquo;lokas">&#346;lokas</span></i> or distichs, in which they
summarised the duties enjoined by their religion<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e795src" href="#xd0e795">20</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. We are worshippers of Ahura Mazda (the Supreme Being), of the sun
and of the five elements.</p>

<p>2. We observe silence during bath, at prayers, while making
offerings to the fire, and when eating.</p>

<p>3. We use incense, perfumes and flowers in our religious
ceremonies.</p>

<p>4. We honour the cow.</p>

<p>5. We wear the sacred garment, the <i>Sudra</i> or the shirt, the
<i>Kusti</i> or thread for the waist, and the twofold cap. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22">22</a>]</span></p>

<p>6. We rejoice ourselves with songs and musical instruments on
marriage occasions.</p>

<p>7. We permit our women to wear ornaments and use perfumes.</p>

<p>8. We are enjoined to be liberal in our charities and especially in
excavating tanks and wells.</p>

<p>9. We are enjoined to extend our sympathies to all beings, male or
female.</p>

<p>10. We practise ablutions with <i>gaomutra</i>, one of the products
of the cow.</p>

<p>11. We wear the sacred thread when praying and eating.</p>

<p>12. We feed the sacred fire with incense.</p>

<p>13. We offer up prayers five times a day.</p>

<p>14. We carefully observe conjugal fidelity and purity.</p>

<p>15. We celebrate annual religious ceremonies in honour of our
ancestors.</p>

<p>16. We observe the greatest precautions with regard to our wives
during their confinement and at certain periods of the month.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice that, at this juncture, the Zoroastrians
showed themselves singularly skilful and clever, avoiding all mention
of the true basis of their religion, and only setting forth certain
ceremonies, of no importance, which seemed of a nature likely to
conciliate the goodwill of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23"
href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>Rana. Anxious to find some place of repose,
the Parsis knew the Hindoos and their susceptibilities of caste and
religion too well not to be willing to please them; and that is why
they formulated their answers with a prudence and skill which won the
favour of the Rana. He therefore permitted them to reside in the city
on condition that they adopted the language of the country, and ceased
to speak that of their ancestors; that their women should dress
according to the Hindoo mode; that the men should no longer carry
weapons, and should perform their marriage ceremonies at night,
according to Hindoo custom. What could the unfortunate exiles,
thirsting for peace and rest, do but accept these conditions? And this
they did. They settled down in a vast tract of land not far from
Sanjan, and with full hearts offered prayers to Hormuzd. They resolved
to fulfil the vow they had made at the time of their memorable voyage
from Diu to Sanjan, to raise the altar for lighting the sacred fire.
The Hindoos, far from opposing this, helped to build the temple (721),
and Zoroastrian rites and ceremonies began to be performed from that
time on Indian soil. (<i>Parsee Pr&acirc;k&acirc;sh</i>, p. 2.)</p>

<p>For nearly three hundred years the Parsis lived peacefully at
Sanjan; but with time, their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href=
"#pb24">24</a>]</span>numbers having increased, some emigrated to other
places: in the north, to Cambay,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e857src"
href="#xd0e857">21</a> Ankleswar,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e865src"
href="#xd0e865">22</a> Variav, Vankaner and Surat; in the south, to
Thana<a class="noteref" id="xd0e873src" href="#xd0e873">23</a> and
Chaul, places still to be found on the map of India. Their first
migration from Sanjan seems to have been to Cambay (942&ndash;997).
Several considerations attracted them to this place, and, besides, they
seem to have prospered there.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e881src" href=
"#xd0e881">24</a> The settlement of Variav seems to have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>been as old as that
of Cambay. A Pehlvi inscription on the sides of the Kanheri caves,
tells us that a certain number of Parsis visited them on the 2nd of
December, 999, and according to another similar Pehlvi inscription,
other Parsis seem to have visited them on the 5th of November, 1021.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e891src" href="#xd0e891">25</a></p>

<p>We then find the Parsis at Naosari<a class="noteref" id="xd0e905src"
href="#xd0e905">26</a>; in 1142 a Mobed named Camdin Yartosht quitted
Sanjan with his family, to perform there some religious ceremonies
required by the Zoroastrians of that place. If we follow the authority
of a certain manuscript preserved by the descendants of Meherji Rana,
the celebrated High Priest who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26"
href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>lived three centuries ago, it was from the
Parsis that Naosari received its name. When they arrived
there&mdash;511, Yezdezard&mdash;they found the climate as pleasant as
that of Mazanderan, one of the provinces of Persia, and called it
Navisari or Nao-Sari. Since then it has been called Naosari-Nagmandal
instead of Nagmandal, its old name.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e915src"
href="#xd0e915">27</a></p>

<p>From the narrations of different travellers it would seem that the
Parsis had settled in a great many cities of Upper India; but it is
impossible to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=
"#pb27">27</a>]</span>say whether these came from Western India or from
Persia. A Mahomedan traveller of the tenth century, Al Isthakhri,
mentions several parts of India as being occupied by the Guebres: that
is the name given by Mahomedan writers to the Parsis. An
unexceptionable testimony of their presence at Dehra-Dun (1079) is
furnished to us in the attack of Ibrahim the Ghaznevid against a colony
of fire-worshippers living in that place. Similarly we find the Parsis
in the Panjaub before 1178, if we are to believe the tradition of a
voyage made that year by a Parsi priest named Mahyar; he had come from
Uch, a town situated on the conflux of the five rivers of the Panjaub,
to Seistan in Persia, in order to acquire a thorough knowledge of the
religious rites. After six years of study under the Dastoors he brought
into India, in 1184, a copy of the Pehlvi translation of the <i>
Vendidad</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e936src" href="#xd0e936">28</a>
It seems also that there must have been some intercourse between the
Parsis of Cambay and those of the Panjaub, since, in 1328, the former
were in possession of some copies of the <i>Vendidad</i> acquired by
Mahyar.</p>

<p>At the time of the invasion of India by Timur, we find Parsis or
Magi amongst the captives. The men who have been represented as
believing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href=
"#pb28">28</a>]</span>in the two principles of good and evil, and
admitting at the same time Yazdan (God) and Ahreman (the Devil), and
who offered a desperate resistance to Timur at Tughlikhpur, were the
Parsis. It is said besides that the colony at Gujerat was reinforced by
a large number of Parsis, who fled before the conqueror. The mention
made by a Mahomedan writer of the destruction of fire-temples by the
Emperor Sikandar (1504), shows that long before this date Parsi
emigrants had dwelt in Upper India. Sir H. M. Elliot, in his <i>History
of India</i>, following the opinion of Professor Dawson, affirms that
the <i>Guebres</i> of Rohilkhand, the <i>Magyas</i> of Malwa, and the
<i>Maghs</i> of Tughlikhpur, although at present they offer no
religious peculiarities, are the remnants of the Parsis of Upper India.
According to a communication anent Mount Abu by Sir Alexander Burnes,
cited in the <i>Gazetteer of Bombay</i>, there had been a Parsi colony
at Chandrauli towards the middle of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>It is believed that the Parsis settled at Ankleswar in the middle of
the thirteenth century of our era. One of their religious books, the
<i>Vispered</i>, was in fact copied there in 1258. There is no doubt of
their having been at Bharooch<a class="noteref" id="xd0e969src" href=
"#xd0e969">29</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href=
"#pb29">29</a>]</span>before the commencement of the fourteenth
century, for we find that a &ldquo;Dokhma&rdquo; was built there in
1309 by a Parsi named Pestanji; and the ruins of a still older Tower
are to be found in the suburb of Vajalpoor.</p>

<p>The settlements at Thana and Chaul must have been founded at an
early date; Mahomedan and European travellers mention them in speaking
of these two places, without giving them their true name. However, the
description given of them agrees very much with that of the Parsis; and
this idea is confirmed by Odoric, an Italian monk who was travelling in
India about the beginning of the fourteenth century.<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e986src" href="#xd0e986">30</a> The people (at Thana) were,
according to him, idolaters, for they worshipped fire, serpents, and
trees, and did not bury their dead, but carried them with great pomp to
the fields, and cast them down as food for <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb30" href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>beasts and birds. Now, as the
Hindoos either burn or bury their dead, the custom here described
relates evidently to the Parsis who, later on, left this place in a
body. A tradition preserved at Thana furnishes an amusing instance of
the manner in which the colony contrived to escape a forced conversion
to Christianity. The Parsis, constrained to renounce their faith, and
having no means of escape, succeeded by cunning in avoiding the
persecutions they were threatened with. They repaired in a body to the
governor and declared themselves ready to embrace Christianity,
demanding as an only favour a delay till the following Sunday before
renouncing their faith, in order to take advantage of the few days of
respite to worship the sacred fire and celebrate, for the last time,
their festivals. The Portuguese were so pleased with this prompt
submission to their will that a proclamation was issued to the effect
that, on the day fixed, no one should interfere with the Mazdiens in
the performance of their rites and ceremonies. The Parsis prepared a
great feast, to which all the notables were invited; wine flowed
freely, and while the guests were indulging themselves in it, the
Parsis, to the sound of music and in the middle of the dancing, left
the town and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31">31</a>]</span>reached Kalyan, to the south of Thana, where they
settled.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1000src" href="#xd0e1000">31</a></p>

<p>Travellers in India from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries
have found Parsis in different places. There is reason to believe that
at that time nothing of any importance befell the community. The Parsis
lived amicably with the Hindoos, and were chiefly occupied in
agriculture. About 1305 an event of considerable importance occurred in
their history, at the time of a struggle maintained by the Hindoo chief
of Sanjan against Mahmood Shah or Ala-ud-din Khilji (<i>Parsee
Pr&acirc;k&acirc;sh</i>, p. 4), who had sent into Gujerat a strong army
commanded by Alp Khan.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1011src" href=
"#xd0e1011">32</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href=
"#pb32">32</a>]</span></p>

<p>The Mahomedan general arrived before Sanjan with thirty thousand
men; the Hindoo prince, conscious of his danger, appealed to those whom
his ancestors had so generously received into their country. The Parsis
were not unmindful of this, and fourteen hundred of them, under the
command of Ardeshir, joined the troops of the Rana. In defending his
cause they were equally defending their own independence and religious
liberty which they had come to seek under his kindly protection. The
armies met not far from Sanjan. Already were the Hindoos giving way
under the stress of the Mahomedans when the Parsis engaged directly in
the combat. Ardeshir and his followers rushed into the thick of the
fight and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href=
"#pb33">33</a>]</span>compelled Alp Khan to fly. But the Mahomedan
general soon re-appeared with reinforcements. Ardeshir, addressing the
Hindoo prince, swore to him the most complete fidelity, and although
the enemy was in numbers superior to his handful of men, he returned to
the field of battle.</p>

<p>It was at this time that a single combat took place between Ardeshir
and one of the Mahomedan chiefs, a combat in which the latter was
thrown from his horse and killed by the Parsi. Alp Khan, enraged by
this scene, threw himself in the contest. A furious carnage followed,
and Ardeshir was struck in his turn by a dart which threw him off his
horse. The Rana perished, and Alp Khan became master of Sanjan. The
Parsis had to seek a new residence.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1038src"
href="#xd0e1038">34</a></p>

<p>They had much to suffer from this Mahomedan conquest, and therefore
many fled to the mountains of Bahrout, eight miles east of Sanjan; the
cave where the sacred fire was deposited is still to be seen. According
to the <i>Kissah-i-Sanjan</i>, the fugitives remained there only twelve
years, after which they quitted this mountainous district <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>and went to
Bansdah,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1051src" href="#xd0e1051">35</a>
about fifty miles north-east of Naosari, where a few Parsi families had
already settled. Fourteen years later (1331) they bore the sacred fire
to Naosari, where their co-religionists were numerous and influential.
But the date 1419 being generally accepted as the year in which the
sacred fire was brought to Naosari, it may be presumed that between the
flight of the Parsis from Sanjan and the era of their new independence,
a whole century, and not twenty-six years, must have elapsed.</p>

<p>From Naosari the fire was removed to Surat, on account of the
apprehensions of the inroads of the Pindaris, and was again removed to
Naosari three years later; thence, owing to certain disputes among the
priests, it was taken to Balsar. After being there for some time it was
transferred to Udwada on October 28, 1742; here it is to this day; and
here is to be seen the oldest fire-temple of the Zoroastrians in India,
and the one held in the greatest veneration (<i>Parsee
Pr&acirc;k&acirc;sh</i>, p. 95). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35">35</a>]</span></p>

<p>In the midst of the calamities that followed the overthrow of the
Rana of Sanjan, the Parsis continued to apply themselves to
agriculture. A single incident deserves being related. One of their
small colonies had settled in Variav, not far from Surat, and was under
the rule of the Rajah of Rattampoor, a Rajput chief who attempted to
impose an extraordinary tribute on the Parsis. They refused, and
defeated the soldiers sent to enforce it. The Raja&rsquo;s soldiers
then sought an opportunity of avenging themselves, and seized the
moment when the Parsis were invited to a wedding. These, surprised in
the midst of their wives and children, were all ruthlessly massacred.
The anniversary of this cruel carnage is still observed at Surat.</p>

<p>The settlement of the Parsis in this latter place is the most recent
of all. The earliest mention made of it does not go further back than
1478. It was there that the community first acquired its great
importance and came in contact with the Europeans. We shall see its
destiny further on.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to assign a fixed date to the arrival of the
Parsis in Bombay. It seems probable that they were induced to do this
by English merchants, and that their first settlement in this island
was a little before the time it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36"
href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>was ceded to England by the Portuguese, as
the dowry of Catherine of Braganza on her marriage with the Stuart king
Charles II. (1668).</p>

<p>Dr. Fryer, who visited Bombay in the year 1671,<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e1075src" href="#xd0e1075">36</a> says: &ldquo;On the other side
of the great bay, towards the sea, there is a sort of promontory called
Malabar Hill, a rocky mountain covered with woods, on the top of which
is a recently erected Parsi tomb.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1080src" href="#xd0e1080">37</a> Now, as the first care of the
Parsis, wherever they settle, is to construct a &ldquo;Tower of
Silence,&rdquo; it is to be presumed that the community could not have
been of any importance before this period; it has prospered since. It
is in Bombay at the present time that can be best studied the changes
that have been going on for two centuries, and which make the modern
Parsis the most loyal subjects of the British Crown, and the most
active agents of civilisation and progress.</p>

<p>In this first chapter we have confined ourselves to a summary
indication of their principal settlements <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb37" href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>in the Presidency and to a succinct
recital of the most prominent events which have signalised their
sojourn in India before the arrival of the Europeans. We will now
freely approach the study we have proposed to undertake. The reader
will not, we hope, lose sight of their grievous exodus; and, at the
height of the fame of the Dadiseths, the Banajis, the Jamshedji
Jijibhoys, the Camas, the Petits, and many other no less illustrious
names, will remember the first fugitives of Persia, and their kindly
reception by the Rana of Sanjan. &ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; said the
prince, &ldquo;welcome to those who walk faithfully in the way of
Hormuzd! May their race prosper and increase! May their prayers obtain
the remission of their sins, and may the sun smile on them! May Lakshmi
by her liberality and her gifts contribute to their wealth and to the
fulfilling of their desires; and, for ever, may their rare merits of
race and intellect continue to distinguish them in our midst!&rdquo;

action, Sa&rsquo;d had withdrawn into the castle<a class="noteref" id=

</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="footnote">There exists a great number of poems composed in
honour of this battle, one of the most celebrated, and fraught with the
greatest blessings for the Mussulmans. Omar having written to
Sa&rsquo;d to ask for some information regarding the position of
Quadesyeh, the latter sent him the following:&mdash;&ldquo;Quadesyeh is
situated between the moat and el-&rsquo;Atiq (the canal of the
Euphrates). On its left is the sea, a sort of bay, whence lead two
roads to Hirah: the first, over high hills; the second, over the banks
of a river called <i>Khousous</i>, which passes out between Khawarnaq
and Hirah; on its right are numerous streams which water the country.
All the tribes who have made peace with the Mussulmans before my
arrival tremble before the Persians, and are ready to assist me.&rdquo;
The historians of the first conquests divide this affair at Quadesyeh
into four battles. The first is called <i>the battle of Ermath</i>; the
second, <i>the battle of Aghwath</i>; the third, <i>the battle of
Amas</i>; the evening preceding the fourth, they called <i>the evening
of Herir</i> or of the storm; and the last, <i>the battle of
Quadesyeh</i>. The celebrated Rustam, son of Farrokh-Zad, lost his life
in this battle, and the Persians could not replace this skilful
general. (<i lang="fr">Dictionnaire geographique, historique et

town about three days&rsquo; journey from Hamadan, in the direction of
the <i>qiblah</i> (south-west). Abo&ucirc;l-Moundher Hischam says it
received this name because it was found wholly built, and in the same
condition as at present. Others carry back its foundation to Noah, and
think that its present name is an abbreviation of <i>Nouh-Awend</i> or
<i>Nouh-Wand</i>, that is to say, the city of Noah. Hamzah thinks that
its old name was <i>Nouha-Wend</i>, which means &ldquo;the well
multiplied.&rdquo; Nehawend is situated in the fourth climate, 72&deg;
longitude and 36&deg; latitude; it is one of the oldest cities of
Djebal. It was conquered about the year 19 or 20 of the Hejira. Abou
Bekr el-Hodha&iuml;li, relying upon the testimony of Mohammed, son of
Hasan, says: &ldquo;The battle of Nehawend was fought in the year 21,
under the Caliphate of Omar, son of Khatthab. The Mussulmans were
commanded by No&rsquo;m&acirc;n ben Mokarren el-Mouzeni; this general
had under him Hodha&iuml;fah, son of Yemani, Djerir ben &rsquo;Abd
Allah, el-Mogha&iuml;rah ben Scha&rsquo;bah and el-Asch&rsquo;ath ben
Qa&iuml;s.&rdquo; When No&rsquo;m&acirc;n, who was one of the
companions of the Prophet, was killed, the commandership passed into
the hands of Hodha&iuml;fah; it was this chief who concluded the peace,
as we attribute it to the word <i>Mah-Dinar</i>. This is what
el-Moubarek ben S&aacute;&iuml;b, who derived this information from his
father, relates: &ldquo;Nehawend was taken by the army of Koufah, and
Dinewer by the troops of Basrah. As the population of Koufah had
considerably increased, some of its inhabitants were obliged to
emigrate into the countries newly pacified and subject to Kharadj. It
is thus that they came to inhabit Dinewer. The province of Koufah was
received in exchange for Nehawend, which was annexed to the province of
Ispahan, the remainder of Kharadj being taken off from Dinewer and
Nehawend. It was in the reign of Mo&rsquo;awiah ben Abi Soufi&acirc;n
that Nehawend was called <i>Mah-el-Basrah</i> and Dinewer <i>
Mah-el-Koufah</i>. The Persians, before the battle of Nehawend, had
gathered together considerable troops; it is said that their army
numbered about 150,000 men commanded by <i>Firouz&acirc;n</i>. After
this important battle, which was called the &lsquo;Victory of
Victories,&rsquo; the resistance of the Persians became less and less.
The most accredited opinion is that these events took place during the
fifth year of Omar&rsquo;s Caliphate, the year 19 of the Hejira.&rdquo;

country stretching from Iraq (Persian) to Azadwar (the chief town of
the province of Djoue&iuml;n) and to Be&iuml;haq. It is bounded on the
side of India (on the south and east) by Thokharistan, Ghaznee,
Sedjestan, and Kirman. It contains fine cities, such as Nisabour,
Merve, which has been the capital of Balk, Herat, Thaleqan, Nesa,
Abiwerd, Serakhs, and other large cities situate on this side of the
river Oxus. Some geographers have placed the provinces of Kharezm and a
part of Transoxiana in Khorassan, but that is an error.... When Islam
appeared in the world, the Khorassanians, by a quite special favour of
Providence, eagerly welcomed it. They accepted without opposition the
peace offered them; hence they were subjected to a light tax only, and
escaped being massacred or made prisoners. The conquest itself took
place in the eighteenth year of the Hejira. &rsquo;Omar ben Khattab
sent into Khorassan El-Ahnef ben Qa&iuml;s, who in a short time took
possession successively of the two Thab&eacute;s, Herat, Merv
esch-Schahidj&acirc;n and Nisabour, after having forced the Persian
king Yezdezard, son of Schahriar, to take refuge in Transoxiana with
the Khan of the Turks. (See B. de Meynard, <i>Dict. geog., hist.</i>,

<p class="footnote">Mohammed Medjdi gives some historical details
concerning the old town and island of Hormuz up to the time of the
conquest of Albuquerque (1514): &ldquo;The town of Hormuz is situated
in the second climate, and the heat there is excessive. Founded by
Ardeschir Babe&#285;an, it was abandoned (in 715) by King Schems
ed-din, who feared the attacks of the neighbouring brigands. This king
built another town in the island of Djeroun, about one <i>farsakh</i>
from the coast, and kept for it the name of <i>Hormuz</i>. For a
hundred and twenty years the <i>Franks</i> have exercised there an
absolute power. Its governor, Nour ed-Din, having conceived the fatal
idea of asking their assistance when in a difficult situation, allowed
them a tenth part of its revenue. In a short time they so skilfully
usurped the authority that the king and the vezir of the country had
not the least share in the government.&rdquo; (<i>Zinet</i>, chapter
ix.) Before the Portuguese conquest, this island, tributary to Persia
and annexed to Kirman, paid an annual contribution of sixty thousand
dinars. (<i>Nouzhet</i>, fol. 670. See also the Arabic text of

Gulf of Cambay, to the south of the Gujerat Peninsula. Its length from
east to west is six miles and a half, and its greatest extent from
north to south is one mile. It has a small but very fine harbour. The
climate is dry and stifling, the soil barren, water scarce, and
agriculture much neglected. Its principal products are wheat, millet,
<i>nachni</i>, <i>bajri</i>, cocoanut, and some kinds of fruits. The
population of Diu consists of about 10,765 inhabitants, of whom 419 are
Christians, 9,575 Hindoos, and 771 Mahomedans. At its most flourishing
period the number had risen, it is said, to nearly 50,000. Now there
are not more than 3,107 houses, very poor and uncomfortable for the
most part. In fact, the commerce of Diu is now ruined. The resources of
the inhabitants consisted formerly in weaving and dyeing; fishing is
their only occupation. Some bold minds attempt trading on the
Mozambique coast. The appearance of Diu is interesting. The fortress,
rebuilt after the siege of 1545 by Dom Joan de Castro, is imposing in
appearance. To the west, the town extends divided in two quarters, that
of the Christians and that of the Pagans. Of the fine edifices of Diu,
there still remains the college of the Jesuits turned into the
Cathedral church; of the other convents, that of Saint Fran&ccedil;ois

souls. The settlement is composed of two distinct parts; Damman and the
<i>pargana</i> of Nagar Haveli, separated by a territory belonging to
the English and by a railroad running through Bombay, Baroda, and
Central India. The town was sacked by the Portuguese in 1532, then
rebuilt by the natives, and re-taken by the Portuguese in 1558, and
made by them one of their settlements in India. They have converted the
mosque into a church, and have built eight others. Commerce flourished
there before the fall of the Portuguese power in India, and extended
even as far as the African coasts, where ships carried the cotton
stuffs manufactured at Damman. From 1817 to 1837 the trade in opium,
brought from Karachi and imported into China, was prosperous; but since
the conquest of Sind by the English the transport of opium has been
prohibited, and Damman has thus been deprived of its greatest source of
wealth. The soil is moist and fertile, specially in the <i>pargana</i>
of Nagar Haveli; rice, wheat, and tobacco are grown there; but in spite
of the facilities for agriculture, only a twentieth part of the
territory is cultivated. (See <i>Imp. Gaz. of India</i>, vol. iii. p.

Bombay. It possesses a station and a port. (See <i>Imp. Gaz. of
India</i>, vol. ix. p. 34.)</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=
"#xd0e881src" id="xd0e881">24</a></span> Some Parsis who, since their
arrival in India, in 636, had remained in the south of Gujerat, were
attracted to the temple of Kumarika Kshetra, on the mouth of the Mahi
(tenth century). These new-comers succeeded in commerce, and were
followed by others, so that the Parsi element became sufficiently
strong to drive the Hindoos from the town. Amongst those who fled there
was a certain Kalianrai who, taking refuge in Surat, acquired a great
fortune by trading in pearls. His wealth gained him some importance; so
that he gathered together a band of Rajputs and Kolis, who attacked the
Parsis one night, set fire to their houses, and put some to the sword;
the rest took to flight. Kalianrai then formed a project to build a
town on the ruins of the Parsi colony. (See <i>Gazetteer of the Bombay
Presidency</i>.)</p>

attributes its foundation to Thahomurs. (See also B. de Meynard, <i

According to Fraser it had a population of 30,000 inhabitants towards
the commencement of the century. D&rsquo;Anville and Rennell have tried
to identify Sari with the ancient Zadra-Karta, the greatest city of
Hyrcania, where the army of Alexander stopped to sacrifice to the gods.
It was here that the great achievements of the heroic times of Persia
are supposed to have been accomplished. Feridoon, the legendary hero of
the Persians, is supposed to be buried under the threshold of a mosque,
which is erected on the site of a Fire Temple. Sari is surrounded by
immense gardens, and the country around is covered with mulberry trees,
cotton plants, sugar cane, and rice fields. It has a port on the
Caspian Sea, at the mouth of the Tedjun, called Farahabad, <i>the abode
of joy</i>, founded by Shah &rsquo;Abbas. Pietro della Valle speaks of
it as the principal city of Mazanderan.</p>

that the author of the <i>Kissah-i-Sanjan</i> thought that the
Mussulman prince was the famous Mahmood Begada. But the conquest of
Gujerat by Alp Khan was so complete that it leaves no doubt that Sanjan
fell into his hands. The conqueror might possibly, though less likely,
be Mahmood Shah Tughlik, who re-conquered Gujerat and the Thana coast
in 1348, and not Mahmood Begada, as the authorities agree in saying
that, after long wanderings, the Fire was brought from Sanjan to
Naosari about the beginning of the fifteenth century (1419). Alp Khan
may be either Ulugh Khan, Ala-ud-din&rsquo;s brother, who is sometimes
called by mistake Alp Khan, or he may be Alp Khan, Ala-ud-din&rsquo;s
brother-in-law. Ulugh Khan conquered Gujerat (1295&ndash;1297) and Alp
Khan governed it (1300&ndash;1320). The Alp Khan of the text was

<h2 class="label">Chapter II</h2>

<h2 class="normal">The Zoroastrians in Persia</h2>

<p>Let us now turn to the Zoroastrians who had remained behind in their
fatherland. Although it is only by the way that we have to treat of
this subject, it is nevertheless proper not to leave out of notice this
nucleus of the Mazdien community who have remained so faithful to the
religion of their ancestors, and who have been so tried in their long
residence in the midst of powerful and pitiless conquerors. We shall
have occasion, besides, in the course of this work, to look back upon
these far-off regions, to note the frequent relations between the
Parsis of Persia and their brethren of India, and the inestimable
benefits secured by the wealthy Parsis of Bombay for the unfortunate
Guebres of Yezd and Kirman.</p>

<p>Two hundred years after the Mahomedan <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb39" href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>conquest the condition of Persia had
entirely changed. The national spirit was dead, and the entire
population had embraced Islamism. It is in the presence of changes so
sudden and so complete that one feels justified in raising the
disquieting question of the influence of race and surroundings on the
history of a nation. We do not need to address ourselves to modern
thinkers to find it clearly formulated.</p>

<p>According to Renan, as far back as the second century, Bardesane had
wondered that &ldquo;If man is the creature of his surroundings and of
circumstances, how is it that the same country is seen to produce human
developments entirely different? If man is governed by the laws of
race, how is it that a nation which has changed its religion, for
example, become Christian, comes to be quite different from what it
used to be?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1104src" href=
"#xd0e1104">1</a> We have only to substitute the epithet <i>
Mahomedan</i> for the epithet <i>Christian</i> to bring the question to
the point. How, in fact, could such a radical change be effected, and
to what degree of despair must the Zoroastrians have reached, to submit
to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href=
"#pb40">40</a>]</span>levelling laws of Islam? If we attempted to
explain this we should have to go back to the history of the internal
agitations and the policy of the Persian Court, and their study would
draw us away too far. We have noticed only the chief events of its
history, without stopping to gather any instruction from facts. Let it
suffice to say that the same causes made the Arabs victorious over the
Byzantine emperor and the Persian Shah-in-Shah, and that these causes
were the weakness and exhaustion of the national dynasties in the
presence of the vital elements of the conquerors. The people suffered
from the carelessness of their kings; individual energy was powerless
against the invasion of disciplined and fanatical tribes, commanded by
generals like Omar and his officers.</p>

<p>The Persian nation was singularly maltreated.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1123src" href="#xd0e1123">2</a> The national unity was broken.
Each province accommodated itself in the best way it could to the <i>
r&eacute;gime</i> imposed by circumstances and by the inclinations of
local chiefs. From that time the boundaries of the ancient kingdom
underwent changes from century to century. In the tenth century, Taher,
governor of Khorassan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41">41</a>]</span>threw off the heavy yoke of the Caliphs of
Bagdad, and established, in his province, the authority of the
Taherides. After them came the Saffarides, the Samanides and all those
foreign dynasties that divided the sovereignty amongst themselves, such
as the Ghaznevides, the Seldjoukides, &amp;c.; finally there came, with
all its calamities, the torrent of invasions to which succeeded the
reigns of the Sophis, and of those dynasties, cruel and grasping, which
have succeeded each other on the throne of Persia without doing
anything for the true welfare of the people.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the followers of Zoroaster who would not accept the
religion of Islam expatriated themselves. Those who could not abandon
their country, and continued to cling to their old religion, had to
resign themselves to frightful sufferings. These dwelt chiefly in Fars
and Khorassan. European travellers who have visited Persia at different
periods, have all been struck by their miserable and precarious
condition, and have felt interested in their language, religion, and
customs. We quote here some of them:</p>

<p>Pietro della Valle, at the time of his sojourn in Persia, studied
them closely, and this is what he has to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;These past few days I have been to see their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>new town<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e1144src" href="#xd0e1144">3</a> (that of the Gaures),
or, let us say, their separate habitation, which, like the new <i>
Ciolfa</i> inhabited by the Christian Armenians, like the new <i>
Tauris</i>, or <i>Abbas-Abad</i>, where dwell the Mahomedans brought
from <i>Tauris</i>, adjoins Ispahan, just as if it were a suburb; and
although, at present, it is separated from it by some gardens,
nevertheless with time,&mdash;for the number of inhabitants greatly
increases every day,&mdash;<i>Ispahan</i> and this habitation of the
<i>Gaures&gt;</i>, with the two others aforesaid, will make but one
place. I am therefore doubtful whether to call them separate citadels,
or suburbs, or rather considerable parts of this same town of Ispahan,
as is the region beyond the Tiber and our city of Rome. This habitation
of the <i>Gaures</i> has no other name that I know of except Gauristan;
that is to say, according to the Persians, &lsquo;the place of the
infidels,&rsquo; just as we call the quarters <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb43" href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>of the Jews, Jewry. This place is
very well built; the streets are wide and very straight, and much finer
than those of Ciolfa, for it was built later with more design; but all
the houses are low and one-storied, without any ornament, quite
consistent with the poverty of those that occupy them, and in this
respect very different from the houses of <i>Ciolfa</i>, which are very
magnificent and well planned; for the Gaures are poor and
miserable,&mdash;at least they show all possible signs of being such;
in fact, they are employed in no traffic; they are simply like
peasants,&mdash;people, in short, earning their livelihood with much
labour and difficulty. They are all dressed alike, and in the same
colour which resembles somewhat brick cement.&rdquo; (<i>Voyages</i>,
French translation, Paris, 1661, vol. ii. p. 104.)</p>

<p>About the same time (1618), Figueroa, the ambassador of Philip III.
in Persia, remarks as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the most eastern part of Persia, and in the province of
<i>Kirm&acirc;n</i>, which forms its frontier to the east, there have
remained some of those ancient and true Persians, who, although they
have mixed with the others, and by uniting themselves to their
conquerors, have become like one people, all the same retain their
primitive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href=
"#pb44">44</a>]</span>mode of living, their customs and their religion.
Thus, at this day, they adore the sun as did the ancient Persians
during the period their empire was the first in this world, and,
following their example, they invariably keep in their houses a lighted
fire, which they keep up unextinguished with as much care as the Vestal
Virgins of Rome did.&rdquo; (<i>The Embassy of Don Garcias de Silva de
Figueroa in Persia.</i> Trans. Wicquefort, Paris, 1667, in 4to, p.
177.)</p>

<p>Thevenot (1664&ndash;67) declares that &ldquo;there are in Persia,
at the present day, and particularly in Kerman, people who worship the
fire like the Persians of old, and these are the Guebres. They are
recognised by a dark yellow coloured material of which the men and
women like to have their dresses and veils made, these being the only
ones who wear this colour. Moreover, the Guebre women never cover their
faces, and generally speaking, they are very well formed. These Guebres
have a language which with its characters is understood only by them,
and they are also very ignorant.&rdquo; (<i>Continuation of the Travels
in the East</i>, Second Part, p. 116; Paris, 1674.)</p>

<p>With Daulier (1665) we shall enter the quarters of the Guebres
assigned to them by the Persian king. &ldquo;If you go about a quarter
of a mile from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href=
"#pb45">45</a>]</span>Julpha in the direction of the mountain you will
see a fine village composed of one long street. It is called Guebrabad,
and is the dwelling-place of the Guebres, or the Gauvres, who are said
to be descended from the old Persians who worshipped the fire. The king
has given them this place to live in, having destroyed them in many
other places. They are dressed in a fine tan-coloured woollen stuff,
the dress of the men being of the same form as that of the other
Persians. But the women&rsquo;s dress is entirely different. They keep
their faces uncovered, and wear round their heads a loosely tied scarf
with a veil to cover their shoulders not ill resembling our gipsies.
Their drawers are like the upper part of Swiss hose, reaching to their
heels. Most of their stuffs are manufactured at Kirman, a large town on
the south coast of Persia, where there are several of this sect. They
are so reserved on the subject of their religion that it is difficult
to know anything certain about it. They do not bury their dead, but
leave them in the open air in an enclosure. I entered some of their
houses, where I saw nothing particular except that the women, far from
avoiding us, as the others do, were very glad to see and speak to
us&rdquo; (<i>The Beauties of Persia</i>, p. 51). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46">46</a>]</span></p>

<p>Towards the same time (1665&ndash;1671) when Chardin went to Persia
he found the Zoroastrians spread over the Caramanian desert, and
chiefly in the provinces of Yezd and Kirman. He calls them Guebres from
the Arabic word <i>Gaur</i>, infidels or idolaters, pronounced <i>
Giaour</i> by the Turks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Persian Fire-Worshippers (vol. ix. pp. 134 <i>et
seq.</i>) are not so well formed, nor so fair, as the Mahomedan
Persians, who are the Persians of this day. Nevertheless the men are
robust, having a fairly good stature, and are well featured. The women
are coarse, with a dark olive complexion, due, I think, more to their
poverty than to nature, for some among them have rather fine features.
The men wear their hair and beards long; they put on a short-fitting
vest and a long woollen cap. They dress in cotton, woollen, or mohair
stuff, and prefer the brown or dead-leaf colour as being perhaps most
suited to their condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The women are very coarsely dressed. I have never seen
anything showing such bad grace, nor anything further removed from <i>
galanterie</i>....</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dress of the <i>Guebres</i> so greatly resembles the Arab
dress that one would think the Arabs <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb47" href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>copied it from them when they
conquered their country. They work either as ploughmen or as labourers,
or fullers and workers in wool. They make carpets, caps and very fine
woollen stuffs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;... Their chief occupation is agriculture; ... they regard
it, not only as a fine and innocent employment, but also as a noble and
meritorious one ...</p>

<p>&ldquo;These <i>Ancient Persians</i> are gentle and simple in
manners, and live very peacefully under the guidance of their elders,
who are also their magistrates, and who are confirmed in their
authority by the Persian Government.&rdquo; Then follow numerous
details concerning their manners, beliefs and temples. The chief temple
was then near Yezd, and the high priest, the <i>Dastoor Dastooran</i>,
resided there. (Ed. of Amsterdam, J. L. Delorme, <span class=
"smallcaps">MDCCXI</span>.)</p>

<p>Ker-Porter (1818&ndash;1820) speaks also of the Guebres: &ldquo;Some
of them,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;poor and faithful to their religion,
not having the means of gaining a distant shelter, remained slaves on
their native soil, their souls raised to Heaven, their eyes bent to the
ground, weeping over their profaned sanctuaries. While the wealthier
ones were flying to the mountainous regions of the frontiers, or to the
shores of India, these few <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href=
"#pb48">48</a>]</span>faithful ones ended in finding comparative
security in their extreme poverty, and took refuge in Yezd and Kirman,
far from the eye of the conquerors. Yezd, even now, contains from four
to five thousand of their descendants; and on account of their
relatively large number they are allowed to practise their faith in a
more open manner than in the smaller localities. In general they are
excellent cultivators, gardeners and artisans, &amp;c.&rdquo; (<a href=
"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/5524754"><i>Travels in Georgia, Persia,
&amp;c.</i></a>, vol. ii. p. 46, London, 1821&ndash;1822.)</p>

<p>The census of the Guebre population, taken towards the end of this
century, gives an absurd figure. We find no vestige of them anywhere
except in Yezd, and in the neighbourhood of Teheran, in Kaschan, Shiraz
and Bushire. In 1854, according to the information furnished to the <i>
Persian Amelioration Society of Bombay</i>, and quoted by Mr. Dosabhai
Framji Karaka,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1258src" href=
"#xd0e1258">4</a> the total came to 7,200 individuals, viz., 6,658 at
Yezd (3,310 men and 3,348 women); 450 in Kirman, 50 in Teheran, and
some at Shiraz.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1270src" href=
"#xd0e1270">5</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href=
"#pb49">49</a>]</span></p>

<p>According to the census of October, 1879, by General
Houtum-Schindler,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1276src" href=
"#xd0e1276">6</a> the Zoroastrian population comprised 8,499
individuals, of whom 4,367 are men and 4,132 women, they being
distributed in the following manner: In Yezd, 1,242; in the surrounding
districts, 5,241; in Kirman, 1,498; in the surrounding districts, 258;
at Bahramabad, 58; at Teheran, 150; at Kaschan, 15; at Shiraz, 25; at
Bushire, 12. The latest census (1892) shows a sensible increase of the
population, rising to 9,269 individuals.</p>

<p>Yezd and Kirman are the two most important towns, the former being
about two hundred miles south-east of Ispahan, the latter about three
hundred and eighty miles from the sea, in the port <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>of Bunder Abbas.
They are both situated on the confines of two extensive deserts, the
Dasht-i-Kavir and the Dash-i-Lut, which, to the north, cover an area of
over five hundred miles, and which are separated by a chain of rocky
mountains through which the caravans trace their way with difficulty.
This region is feared by travellers, and is hardly known to
Europeans.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1295src" href=
"#xd0e1295">7</a></p>

<p>Yezd<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1306src" href="#xd0e1306">8</a>
communicates with the rest of Iran only <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb51" href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>by the caravan roads. On leaving the
argillaceous plateaus, the rocks and the sandhills, the town and the
villages around seem to emerge from a veritable oasis of mulberry
trees; the desert begins at the very foot of the walls, where the sand
driven by the tempests is heaped up. A line of ruins surrounds it and
testifies to its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52">52</a>]</span>ancient extent. Yezd is, however, prosperous<span
class="corr" id="xd0e1360" title="Not in source">.</span> It contains a
population of from seventy to eighty thousand inhabitants, composed of
the most diverse elements&mdash;amongst others 2,000 Jews, still
obliged to wear on their cloaks the badge of their disgrace, and some
Hindoos called to this place by their business affairs.</p>

<p>There are five reservoirs, <i>abambars</i>, fifty mosques, eight <i>
madressas</i>, and sixty-five public baths; a post office ensures a
regular weekly service with Bander-Abbas and Bushire; the telegraph
puts it in <span class="corr" id="xd0e1371" title="Source: communicati
on">communication</span> with Kirman and Ispahan. Commerce flourishes;
about the middle of this century eighteen hundred manufactories gave
work to nine thousand workmen. Nowadays the number is, however,
less.</p>

<p>It is here that we find, grouped together, the scattered remnants of
the Zoroastrian community. The Guebres gave themselves up chiefly to
gardening and the cultivation of mulberry trees, notably of the species
of brown fibre, the wearing of which was formerly incumbent on them.
But a great change has taken place, and such a trader now possesses a
thousand camels. There are schools there, four Fire Temples, and
several Towers of Silence. About twenty kilometres to the south-west is
the town of Taft, where was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href=
"#pb53">53</a>]</span>preserved for a very long time the permission to
keep up openly the sacred fire. The community has a high priest, and
also a lay chief, Ardeshir Meherban. Some of the Guebres are
naturalised Englishmen, and thanks to them, for the last fifty years
the trade of Yezd has grown by their intercourse with India. Their <i>
r&ocirc;le</i> is similar to that performed in the open ports of Japan
by the <i lang="es">compradores</i> and the Chinese agents into whose
hands nearly all business passes. This activity is due to the efforts
of their co-religionists in India, for in spite of their recognised
probity and practical intelligence, the Guebres have long been exposed
to the most humiliating vexations.</p>

<p>Kirman is the chief city of ancient Caramania<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1386src" href="#xd0e1386">9</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb54" href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>and stands in the centre of four
great highways which run from the south and the west. Its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>situation makes it a
very important centre of commerce between the Persian Gulf and the
markets of Khorassan, Bokhara, and Balk. Of the twelve thousand Guebres
who were formerly resident in this locality, there only remain,
according to the census taken in 1878 by the orders of the Governor,
thirteen hundred and forty-one.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1424src"
href="#xd0e1424">10</a> At the time of the Arab invasion, Kirman served
as a place of refuge for King Yezdezard, and passed successively into
the hands of the Beni-Buzak, the Seldjoukides Turks, the kings of
Kharezm (Khiva), and a Kara-Kita&iuml;enne family which remained in
power till the year 1300; and it was also the See of the Nestorian
metropolitan bishopric of Fars. This city had to suffer much from the
invasions, from the east and west, of Gengis-Khan, Timour, the Afghans
and Nadirshah. The siege it sustained in 1494 is memorable for the
massacres ordered by Aga Mahomed Khan.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1427src" href="#xd0e1427">11</a> It was within its walls that the
last of the family of the Zends, Luft Ali-Khan, had taken refuge.
Betrayed by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56">56</a>]</span>his followers, the young prince contrived,
however, to escape the cruelty of the redoubtable Kadjar eunuch. For
three months the soldiers committed all sorts of excesses, the town was
given up to plunder<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1435src" href=
"#xd0e1435">12</a> and finally razed. A little later, having been
rebuilt by Fath-Ali-Shah, it recovered by degrees its ancient
prosperity, thanks to a capable and at the same time avaricious and
strict governor, Vekil-ul-Mulk. The ruins of Kirman occupy a length of
three miles. The modern town contained in 1879, 42 mosques, 53 public
baths, 5 <i>madressas</i>, 50 schools, 4 large and small bazaars, and 9
caravanserais. Its commerce is flourishing, the carpets and shawls
manufactured there being very wonderful.</p>

<p>The physical and moral condition of the Guebres has changed very
little in Persia. Their contact with the Mussalmans has neither relaxed
nor enervated that condition. The women, of <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb57" href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>whom the majority belong to poor
families, are renowned for their chastity, while the men are so famous
for their morality that they are particularly employed in the gardens
of the Shah. From an ethnographical point of view, this is what can be
said; we follow the <i lang="fr">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> given by M.
Houssay<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1448src" href="#xd0e1448">13</a>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the Arabs by right of conquest imposed a new religion on
the Persians, the fusion of the Turano-Aryans had been already for the
greater part accomplished in the north and east of the empire. At this
time there was no difference of race, manners, customs or religion
between the ancestors of the Mahomedan Persians and those of the real
Guebres. Separated to-day as surely by their religion as by vast extent
of space, they no longer commingle; but being descended from the same
ancestors, and neither having undergone any modification since that
period, we find them again to-day not unlike each other in the same
region.... The only ethnical element which could have been introduced
among the Persian Mahomedans and not among the Guebres, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>would be the Semitic
element due to the Arab conquerors. But it was not so. The soldiers of
Islam were indeed sufficiently fanatical and violent to impose their
laws and religion on the people, but not sufficiently numerous to
effect any change in them. It would be practically quite the truth to
say that this invasion has left no traces outside the families of the
Seides. The language alone has felt its effects; all words connected
with religion and government are Arabic. The Guebres should be all the
less regarded as pure descendants of the Aryans, as they resemble their
Mussulman neighbours, and are, on the other hand, not all of the same
type. Those of Yezd have, according to Khanikoff, Aryan
characteristics. It is not because they are Guebres, but because they
dwell in a country adjoining Fars. Those of Teheran resemble the other
inhabitants of Teheran. The Parsis of India, whose ancestors preferred
exile to conversion, are more like the Parsis of Persia, and differ
from their co-religionists of the North. Since their exodus, they have
not at all mixed with the people who received them; they are such as
they were then. Thus at the time of the Arabic conquest there was no
single race. The ethnical distribution, which can be observed <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>even now,
existed already. The Guebres who remained in Persia were the
Turano-Aryans; the emigrants, who had chiefly started from the south of
the kingdom, were Aryans.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1473src"
href="#xd0e1473">14</a></p>

<p>The condition of the Zoroastrians who had remained behind in Persia
had been, as we have said, always miserable. In 1511, they wrote to
their co-religionists who had taken refuge at Naosari, that since the
reign of Ka&iuml;omar, they had not endured such sufferings, even under
the execrable government of Zohak, Afrasiab, Tur and Alexander! As a
matter of fact, the connection between the two communities, which had
been broken, was happily renewed since the end <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>of the fifteenth century. At
this period Changa Asa, a rich and pious Parsi of Naosari, had at his
own expense sent a learned layman, Nariman Hoshang, with the view of
acquiring from the members of the Iranian clergy certain information
regarding important religious questions. (<i>Parsee
Pr&acirc;k&acirc;sh</i>, pp. 6&ndash;7.)</p>

<p>In another letter to their co-religionists in India dated from
Serfabad, September 1, 1486, Nariman Hoshang declared that all the
Iranians had been desiring for centuries to know if any of their
co-religionists still existed on the other side of the world! After an
absence of several years he returned to India, and eight years later
went back to Persia, where he collected the most curious information.
These statements are confirmed by the letters of the Guebres addressed
to the Parsi community of India (1511), in which it is said that
&ldquo;since their departure from Persia to the arrival of Nariman
Hoshang (in all thirty years) the Mazdiens had not known that their
co-religionists had settled in India, and that it was only through
Nariman Hoshang that they had come to know of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that period the relations between the Guebres and the Parsis
were sufficiently close. As far back as 1527, one Kama Asa, from <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>Cambay, had
gone to Persia and procured a complete copy of the
Ard&aacute;-Vir&aacute;f-N&aacute;meh. In 1626 the Parsis of Bharooch,
Surat, and Naosari sent to Persia a learned man of Surat, Behman
Aspandiar, charged with numerous questions; he brought back the
answers, and also two religious books, the Vishtasp-Yasht and the
Vispered (<i>Parsee Pr&acirc;k&acirc;sh</i>, p. 11). The information
thus obtained by intelligent emissaries for a long time guided the
Parsis in their decisions regarding social and religious questions, and
formed the collection of the <i>Riv&acirc;y&acirc;ts</i>. At the same
time the members of the community in India were not in a position to
alleviate the miseries of their Persian brethren, and each century
brought to the latter a new increase of sufferings and troubles.</p>

<p>Four revolutions contributed to the destruction of the Zoroastrian
population of Kirman. The Ghilzi-Afghans, who had long groaned under
the yoke of the Persians, rose at last under the command of a brave and
intelligent chief, called Mir Vais, who quickly made himself master of
Khandahar.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1500src" href="#xd0e1500">15</a>
The Persian monarch Hussein, powerless to reduce them by arms, tried to
bring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href=
"#pb62">62</a>]</span>them back to a sense of duty by sending
emissaries, who were however treated with contempt. The Afghan chief
who succeeded Mir Vais resolved in his turn to be revenged by invading
Persia as soon as an opportunity presented itself. It came soon. Whilst
the north-east frontier of the kingdom was threatened by the
Abdali-Afghans of Herat, and whilst the Arabian Prince of Muscat was
taking possession of the coast of the Persian Gulf, Mahmoud, who had
succeeded his father, Mir Vais, in the government of Khandahar, made an
irruption into Persia. This invasion of the Ghilzi-Afghans was the
greatest catastrophe to the Zoroastrian community, Mahmood having
preferred to pass through Kirman rather than risk the deserts of
Seistan. Massacres and forced conversions drove the faithful band to
despair.</p>

<p>At the time of the second invasion of Mahmood he persuaded the
Zoroastrians of Yezd and Kirman to join his troops, and avenge the
wrongs they had suffered for centuries.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1512src" href="#xd0e1512">16</a> It is needless to say that these
unfortunates, too confiding, allowed themselves to be convinced and
enlisted. What do we know of their ultimate fate? What became of them
under the standard <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href=
"#pb63">63</a>]</span>of Mahmood after the victory of Ispahan? (October
21, 1722, H. 1135<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1517src" href=
"#xd0e1517">17</a>). Were they better treated, and did they receive any
recompense? There is reason to believe that their condition, far from
being ameliorated, became worse.</p>

<p>It is said that under the reign of Nadir-Shah and his successors,
they had again to elect between the frightful alternative of conversion
or death. At the time of the siege of Kirman, of which we have spoken
(p. 55), many Zoroastrians were put to the sword, and their quarters
laid waste and destroyed for ever.</p>

<p>This series of vicissitudes and misfortunes accounts for the small
number of the survivors, their precarious life, their difficulties in
the exercise of their religion, and the dispersion of their sacred
books. In the time of Ibn Haukhal each village had its temple, its
priests, and its sacred book. According to Mr. Dosabhai Framji Karaka,
in 1858 there were thirty-five Fire Temples in Yezd and its environs.
At present there are four in Yezd itself, eighteen in the neighbouring
village, and one at Kirman. As for the sacred books <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>there are only those
that are to be found in India. Westergaard, who visited Persia in 1843,
writing to his friend the late Dr. Wilson of Bombay, to inform him of
his disappointment, says,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1529src" href=
"#xd0e1529">18</a> &ldquo;I have stopped in Yezd for eleven days, and
although I have mixed in their gatherings, I have seen but sixteen or
seventeen books in all; two or three copies of the <i>Vendidad
Sad&eacute;</i> and of the <i>Izeschn&eacute;</i>, which they call <i>
Yasna</i>, and six or seven copies of the <i>Khorda-Avesta</i>. I have
only been able to obtain two and a portion of a third, a part of the
<i>Bundahish</i> and of another Pehlvi book. That is all that I have
succeeded in obtaining, in spite of all my efforts to get
more&mdash;for instance, the fragments of the <i>Izeschne</i> with a
Pehlvi or Pazend translation, of which there is only one copy in
Europe, that at Copenhagen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same traveller, speaking of the Zoroastrians who at present
reside in Kirman, expresses himself in these terms: &ldquo;The Guebres
there are more maltreated than their brethren in Yezd. They have only
two copies of the <i>Vendidad</i> and of the <i>Yasna</i> and a rather
large number of the <i>Khorda-Avesta</i>, with which, however, they
will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>not
part. Here nobody reads Pehlvi. They complain bitterly of Aga Mahomed
Khan having given up the city to plunder, of the destruction of most of
their sacred books, and of the massacre of the faithful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the harshest conditions of the conquest of Persia had been at
all times a tax called &ldquo;<i>Jazia</i>.&rdquo; The Mahomedans are
the only persons exempted from this tax, all the other infidel
inhabitants of the kingdom, Armenians, Jews, and Zoroastrians, being
subject to it. The Armenians of Tauris and of the villages of Persia
situated near the frontier have been relieved of this tax by the care
of the Russian Government. It is difficult to arrive at an estimate of
the tax paid by the Armenians and the Jews, but this is
certain&mdash;and the fact has been verified&mdash;that the annual tax
imposed upon the Zoroastrians rose to 660 tomans. The governors and
collectors having gone on increasing its amount in order to profit by
the surplus, the sum rose to nearly 2,000 tomans, or &pound;1,000
sterling, about 25,000 francs of our money. According to statistics, a
thousand Zoroastrians were compelled to pay. Of these two hundred could
pay it without difficulty, four hundred with much trouble; the rest
could not do so even under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href=
"#pb66">66</a>]</span>threats of death. Lamentable scenes have ensued
at the time of the collection of this onerous tax.<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e1573src" href="#xd0e1573">19</a> Sometimes these unfortunate
beings turned to their brethren in India in the hope of obtaining a
favourable intervention with the Persian Government, such as some of
the European Powers had effectually attempted in certain cases.</p>

<p>Dishonoured by the appellation of Guebres or &ldquo;Infidels,&rdquo;
they endured at the hands of the Mussulmans sufferings similar to those
endured in India by the members of the Mahar caste at the hands of the
well-born Hindoos.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1581src" href=
"#xd0e1581">20</a> All relations, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67"
href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>all intercourse with them were tainted with
pollution; a host of lucrative occupations were forbidden to them.
Moreover, we know the frightful inequality of laws in Mahomedan
countries, where the general rule is to grant aid and protection to the
true believers and to ignore these rights in the case of the infidels.
Instances of this are too numerous to be quoted; we will content
ourselves with pointing out this inequality without any further
comment.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1594src" href="#xd0e1594">21</a></p>

<p>In the presence of this painful state of affairs the Parsis in India
could not remain indifferent. Mr. Dosabhai Framji Karaka wrote, a
quarter of a century back:<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1599src" href=
"#xd0e1599">22</a> &ldquo;Can we then do nothing for our unfortunate
brethren in Persia? Our community has considerable funds and possesses
men known throughout the world for their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb68" href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>benevolence and their noble efforts
towards the amelioration of the condition of their co-religionists....
It seems to us that a deputation from us to the Court of Persia,
presented and duly supported by the English Ambassador at Teheran,
might successfully attempt some negotiations with a view to put an end
to the cruelty practised every day. The amount raised by the Capitation
Tax with such useless violence must be to the Imperial treasury
insignificant in the extreme, and there is no doubt that a
representation from the Parsis of India has all chances of being
favourably received. Persian princes seldom know the true state of
their subjects, and we hope our countrymen will comprehend the honour
that will be reflected on them by their efforts to relieve the miseries
of our brethren in Iran.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was in 1854 that the first emissary from Bombay to the
Zoroastrians in Persia was sent; and from that time, thanks to the <i>
Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund</i>, they seriously began to
consider the means of aiding them. The trustees delegated Mr. Maneckji
Limji Antaria, who was to utilise his great experience and his devotion
in the accomplishment of the task he had accepted. He started (March
31st) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href=
"#pb69">69</a>]</span>with instructions from the committee to open an
inquiry and to send in a report. Very soon the most pathetic details
came to excite the charitable zeal of the Parsis of Bombay. A meeting
was called on January 11, 1855, under the presidency of the late
Maneckji Nasarwanji Petit (<i>Parsee Pr&acirc;k&acirc;sh</i>, pp. 654
<i>et seq.</i>) to consider the resolutions to be adopted on the report
of Mr. M. L. Antaria.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1621src" href=
"#xd0e1621">23</a></p>

<p>Before taking in hand all the evils set forth it appeared specially
important to direct all their efforts towards the abolition of the
&ldquo;<i>Jazia</i>,&rdquo; the chief cause of the complaints and
miseries of the tax-payers. These efforts relaxed neither with time nor
with obstacles, and after a campaign which lasted from 1857 to 1882<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e1632src" href="#xd0e1632">24</a> the desired
abolition was finally obtained. During this period of twenty-five long
years all suitable means were taken to secure the success of the object
aimed at. Thus Mr. M. L. Antaria profited by the kindly disposition of
Sir Henry Rawlinson, the English Ambassador at the Court of Teheran, to
get himself presented to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href=
"#pb70">70</a>]</span>the Shah and to lay before him a touching picture
of the miseries suffered by his Zoroastrian subjects of Kirman. At the
end of the audience he succeeded in obtaining a reduction of 100 tomans
from the amount of the contribution annually raised (920 tomans) in
Yezd and in Kirman.</p>

<p>Another audience was granted by the Shah in Buckingham Palace at the
time of his voyage to England (June 24, 1873). A memorandum, drawn up
in the most flowery and courteous style, such as Oriental politeness
demands, was presented by several members of the Bombay Committee.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e1645src" href="#xd0e1645">25</a> Sir Henry
Rawlinson and Mr. E. B. Eastwick supported it. In his reply His Majesty
thought fit to say that he had heard of the complaints of his subjects,
and that he would consider the means of ameliorating the position of
the Zoroastrians of Persia. But we know, alas! that in the East abuses
take long in disappearing. In spite of the friendly promises of the
Shah there was no change made in the collection of this tax. A pressing
appeal through the English Ambassador at Teheran did not even reach the
monarch. It was only in 1882 that Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, the
president <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href=
"#pb71">71</a>]</span>of the <i>Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration
Fund</i>, received through the medium of Mr. Thomson, of the English
Embassy, the communication of the royal firman decreeing the immediate
abolition of the tax (<i>Parsee Pr&acirc;k&acirc;sh</i>, p. 662). This
long struggle has cost the <i>Persian Amelioration Fund</i> of Bombay
nearly 109,564 rupees, or about 257,475 francs! It is needless to say
with what transports of joy and gratitude this boon was received by the
unfortunate victims, who for centuries had groaned under the exactions
of subordinate officials, and whom the enlightened kindness of the
sovereign placed at once on a footing of equality with his other
subjects.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1659src" href="#xd0e1659">26</a> As
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>to the
friends of the Mazdien communities of Iran, they may hope to see them
prosper and their numbers increase under the influence of the same
qualities and virtues which have contributed to the greatness and
prosperity of the Zoroastrians of India.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1681src" href="#xd0e1681">27</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb73" href="#pb73">73</a>]</span></p>

<p>The relations between Bombay and Persia were not confined to this
single benevolent initiative of the Bombay Committee.<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e1690src" href="#xd0e1690">28</a> We should also notice the
establishing of schools in the towns of Yezd and Kirman (1857) due to
the munificence of the Parsee notabilities, and the pecuniary gifts
given for the purpose of settling in life young girls exposed on
account of their poverty to terrible dangers in a Mahomedan country.
Between 1856 and 1865 nearly a hundred Mazdien women were thus got
married by the care of the agent of a charitable association. We may
also mention the establishment of dispensaries and houses of refuge,
and should not omit to include in this brief list the founding of two
monuments, which throws a very interesting light on the direction of
the religious ideas of the modern Parsis.</p>

<p>Two localities, situated not far from Yezd and held sacred by
tradition, Koh-i-Chakmaku and Akda, preserved the memory of their
ancient glorious days through a legend concerning the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>two daughters of
Yezdezard, Khatun Banu and Hyat Banu, who had at one time disappeared
without leaving any trace behind them. After the fall of the king, his
family, finding no protection in Mada&iuml;n, had taken refuge in the
citadel of Haft Ajar; but they were soon obliged to disperse. Meher
Banu shut herself up in the fortress of Gorab; Khatun Banu directed her
steps to more secret places. In her hasty march the princess, exhausted
and dying of thirst, met a <i>burzigar</i> (farmer) busy cultivating
the soil, and asked of him a little water to drink. There being no
stream or tank near, the peasant offered her his cow&rsquo;s milk, and
commenced milking the animal; but the moment the vessel overflowed with
the fresh and foaming liquid, the cow with a kick upset it. The
unfortunate girl, thus deprived of this last comfort, feverishly
continued her way, and reaching the mountain in an agony of despair,
threw herself upon the ground, praying to the Almighty to protect her,
either by stopping the pursuit of her enemies or by screening her from
mortal sight. Hardly had she finished her prayer when she disappeared
in a cleft of the rocks, which opened before her and closed upon her
immediately. At the same moment the <i>burzigar</i>, who had discovered
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>the
retreat of the princess, arrived with a refreshing drink, only to find
her little band of mourning followers. On hearing of her strange
disappearance he ran to his stable and sacrificed the cow in the very
place where the king&rsquo;s daughter had disappeared. Soon the
faithful ones came to offer, in their turn, similar sacrifices, and the
place was called Dari-Din, &ldquo;the Gate of Faith.&rdquo; Hosts of
pilgrims repaired to this place every year, but these sacrifices of
blood were repugnant to the feelings of the Parsis of Bombay. However,
as it was right and seemly to honour a place marked out by ancient
tradition, Mr. Maneckji Limji Antaria substituted in the place of this
barbarous custom ceremonies more in accordance with modern Zoroastrian
practices. The sacrifice of the cow was suppressed, and an influential
member of the Bombay community furnished means to raise a beautiful
monument with spacious quarters to lodge the pilgrims.</p>

<p>Hyat Banu, the other princess, disappeared in an equally mysterious
manner. On the spot consecrated by legend a grand reservoir, fed from
neighbouring springs, has been erected. The walls of this reservoir
having gradually fallen into ruins, they were repaired by the generous
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>care of
Mr. Merwanji Framji Panday, the same gentleman who erected the monument
at Akda.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1709src" href="#xd0e1709">29</a>

Yezd.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Yezd enjoys a temperate climate. It is
surrounded by canals and aqueducts which carry the water into the
interior of the town. There are constructed there reservoirs and
cisterns, structures as remarkable as those which are seen at
Kasch&acirc;n. Most of the houses and edifices, although built of raw
bricks, are of great solidity; besides, the rainfall is very scarce in
that country. The town is well built and very clean, because care is
taken to have the rubbish removed every day from it, which rubbish is
used to manure the fields. Wheat, cotton, and silk are produced there,
but the wheat is not abundant enough to suffice for food, and some
wheat is therefore imported from Kirman and Schiraz, so that its price
is somewhat high. Among the fruits of Yezd are praised figs, called <i>
misqali</i>, and pomegranates. The inhabitants, formerly
Schaf&eacute;&iuml;tes, belong now to the Schiite sect; they are almost
all weavers, and are known for their honesty and by their gentleness,
which degenerates even into weakness. Hamd Allah Must&ocirc;fi, while
doing justice to the loyalty of the merchants, accuses the brokers of
that town of intolerable arrogance and pride.&rdquo; (Zinet
el-Medjalis). (<i>Cf.</i> Nouzhet, fol. 602.) See B. de Meynard, <i>
Dict. geog., hist.</i>, &amp;c., p. 611, note 1.</p>

<p class="footnote">During nearly two centuries the governors
(<i>atabegs</i>) of Yezd, like those of Lauristan, maintained their
independence; but in the thirteenth century Ghazan Khan supplanted
them. As for the modern travellers who have visited those regions, this
is what is known of them: Marco Polo traversed Yezd in 1272, the monk
Odoric in 1325, and Josafa Barbaro in 1474. It was then a city
surrounded with walls nearly five miles in circumference, and well
known by its silk trade. Tavernier, in the seventeenth century, stayed
there for three days, enough to make him extol the fruits and the
beauty of the women of that place; similarly in the nineteenth century
the European <i>savants</i> made acquaintance with that region.
Christie, having left Pottinger in Baloochistan, traversed it while
returning from Herat (1810). (See A. Dupr&eacute; (1808), <a href=

"#xd0e1386src" id="xd0e1386">9</a></span> <i>Kerm&acirc;n</i>&mdash;The
word is written sometimes <i>Kirman</i>; but the first pronunciation
seems more correct. It is a vast and populated country, situate in the
third climate; longitude 90 deg., latitude 30 deg. It contains a great
number of districts, towns, and boroughs. Its boundaries are: To the
east, Mokr&acirc;n and the desert which extends between Mokr&acirc;n
and the sea, near the country of the <i>Belouth</i> (Beloochees); to
the west, Fars; to the north, the deserts of Khorassan and
Sedjest&acirc;n; to the south, the sea of Fars. On the frontier of
Sirdj&acirc;n, Kirman makes an angle and advances into the boundaries
of Fars; it has also a bend on its southern sides. Kirman is rich in
palm-trees, corn, cattle, and beasts of burden; it offers an analogy to
the province of Basrah by the number of its rivers and the fertility of
its territory. This is what has been said by Mahomed bin Ahmed
el-Beschari: &ldquo;Kerm&acirc;n participates in the natural qualities
of Fars; it resembles by its productions the country of Basrah, and it
has also some analogical reference to Khorassan. In fact, its sides are
washed by the sea; it unites the advantages of hot and cold climates;
it produces the nut-tree and the palm-tree, and yields in abundance the
two best species of dates, and produces the most varied trees and
fruits. Its principal cities are, Djiraft, Menouq&acirc;n, Zarend,
Bemm, Sirdj&acirc;n (or Schiradj&acirc;n), Nermasir, and Berdesir.
Tutenag (<i>toutia</i>) is collected there and is imported in large
quantities. The inhabitants are virtuous, honest, and much attached to
Sunnism and orthodoxy. But a great part of this country is depopulated
and ruined, on account of the different masters who possessed it, and
the tyrannical domination of its Sultans. For many years, instead of
having been governed by a particular dynasty, it has been administered
by governors who have had no other occupation than to amass wealth and
to make it pass into Khorassan. Now, this emigration of the resources
of a country to the profit of another is one of the surest causes of
its ruin; besides, the presence of a king and a court contributes much
to the prosperity of a State. The epoch of the glory and splendour of
Kerm&acirc;n reaches to the reign of the Seldjouqide dynasty, and
during that happy period, a great number of foreigners fixed their
residence there.&rdquo; See B. de Meynard, <i>Dict. geog., hist.</i>,

Houtum-Schindler (see <i>Memoir</i> already cited, pp. 82&ndash;84),
the hairs of the Zoroastrians are smooth and thick, generally black, or
of a dark brown colour; one seldom meets with a clear brown colour,
never with the red. In Kirman some beards do assume this colour, but
they incline rather to the yellowish. The eyes are black, or of an
intense brown, sometimes grey or blue, the eyebrows habitually thick
and well furnished among men, delicate and well shaped among women. The
complexion is generally tawny; the cheeks are coloured only among some
women. The inhabitants of the cities are pale in appearance, and not
robust; those of the towns are robust and well proportioned. We regret
not to be able to insert certain types sent for us from Yezd, the
printing of this work being too far advanced to enable us to make use
of them.</p>

"#xd0e1573src" id="xd0e1573">19</a></span> We cannot recount here
odious details which a single word will characterise: they were
veritable <i>dragonnades</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=
"#xd0e1581src" id="xd0e1581">20</a></span> General Houtum-Schindler
ascertained that, before the abolition of the <i>Jazia</i>, the
position of the Guebres was good enough, and infinitely better than
that of the Jews at Teheran, Kaschan, Shiraz, and Bushire, whilst at
Yezd and in Kirman, on the contrary, the position of the Jews was
preferable. The hardships endured were very cruel. (See
Houtum-Schindler, <i>Memoir</i> already cited, p. 57.) Here are the
principal grievances of the Guebres: they were threatened with forced
conversion; property belonging to a Zoroastrian family was confiscated
for the use and profit of the proselytes, in disregard to the rights of
the legitimate heirs; property newly acquired was susceptible of being
burdened with taxes for the benefit of the &ldquo;Mullas&rdquo; up to a
fifth of its value; there was a prohibition against building new houses
and repairing old ones; the Guebres could not put on new or white
coats, nor could they ride on horseback; the traders had to submit to
taxes in addition to the Government duties of the custom house; and
finally the murder of a Zoroastrian was not punished, and often
sanctuaries were invaded and profaned.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=
"#xd0e1594src" id="xd0e1594">21</a></span> It is well to notice that
the Persian Government, very careful to please the ambassadors of the
European and Christian courts, accords voluntarily its protection to
the natives who are in the neighbourhood of the capital; but this
protection ceases in the provinces where there prevails the rule of
local governors maintained by the fanaticism of the inhabitants.</p>

text of the firman relieving the Zoroastrians of Persia from the impost
of the &ldquo;<i>Jazia</i>&rdquo;:</p>

<p class="footnote">&ldquo;In consideration of the innumerable
benedictions which it has pleased the Almighty to accord to us, and as
an act of grace towards Him who has given us the Royal Crown of Persia,
with the means of promoting the welfare of its inhabitants, has
devolved on us the duty of securing tranquillity and happiness for all
our subjects, to whatever tribe, community, or religion they belong, so
that they may be profited and refreshed by the beneficent waters of our
special favour.</p>

<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Amongst these are the Zoroastrians of Yezd
and Kirman, who are descended from the ancient and noble race of
Persia, and it is now our desire to make their peace and well-being
more complete than before.</p>

<p class="footnote">&ldquo;That is why, by this royal firman, we ordain
and command that the taxes and imposts of the Crown, levied previously
on our Musulman subjects of Yezd and Kirman, may be recovered in the
same way from the Zoroastrians who reside there. In this manner the
impost which exacts from this community the sum of eight hundred and
forty-five tomans, is abolished, and in the commencement of this
propitious year of the Horse, we make an abatement of this sum and free
the Zoroastrians from it for ever. We therefore order and command our
<i>mustaufis</i> and officers of the debt of the Royal Exchequer to
remove it from the revenues which have to be paid in by Yezd and
Kirman. The governors now in office, or who will be nominated
subsequently at the head of these provinces, ought to consider all
right to the payment of this tribute abolished for ever, and, as
regards the present year, and the following years, if this sum should
happen to be exacted, they will be held responsible and will be
punished for it. Moreover, in the tribute of the tithes and imposts on
water and land, and for all trade duties, the Zoroastrians must be
treated in the same manner as our other subjects.</p>

<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Given at Teheran, in the month of Ramzan,
1299 (August, 1882), &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is on the western coast of India, in the Bombay Presidency, that
we find the most compact gathering of the members of the Parsi
community. Since their exodus from Persia the refugees here have
maintained themselves successfully, and have gradually acquired wealth
and the intellectual superiority which distinguishes them from the
other natives of India.</p>

<p>The Bombay Presidency, or, to be more exact, the province of
Bombay,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1725src" href="#xd0e1725">1</a>
comprises twenty-four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href=
"#pb78">78</a>]</span>British districts, and nineteen Native States
(Agencies) under the protection of the English Government. Its
boundaries are: To the north, the State of Balouchistan, the Panjaub,
and the native States of Rajputana; to the east, the Mahratta State of
Indore, the Central Provinces, Western Berar and the States of the
Nizam of Hyderabad; to the south, the Madras Presidency and the State
of Mysore; and to the west, the Arabian Sea. It is divided into four
great divisions, made according to the local dialects. On the north
lies Sindh or the lower valley and delta of the Indus, a region
essentially Mahomedan both historically and as regards the population;
then more to the south, Gujerat, containing, on the contrary, the most
diverse and mixed elements, and comprising all the districts of the
northern coast, the Mahratta country, and the interior districts of the
Deccan; and, finally, the provinces where the Canarese language is
spoken, divided in their turn into four British districts and eight
Native States.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1732src" href=
"#xd0e1732">2</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href=
"#pb79">79</a>]</span></p>

<p>This territory has been formed little by little round the Island of
Bombay, ceded to England by the King of Portugal as the dowry of the
Infanta Catherine of Braganza. The Portuguese were the first to occupy
these parts; in 1498 they arrived at Calicut with Vasco de Gama, and
five years later, thanks to the bravery of Albuquerque, they took
possession of Goa. Bombay came into their possession in 1532, and for a
hundred years they managed to maintain themselves at the head of
commerce and traffic. Two rival factories, one English and the other
Dutch, were established in Surat in 1613 and 1618. It must be stated
that the acquisition of the island of Bombay gave but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>little pleasure to
the English, for in 1668, on account of great difficulties, the King
transferred it to the East India Company, and in 1686 the control of
all the possessions of the Company was transferred from Surat to
Bombay, which was made into an independent Presidency (1708) at the
time of the amalgamation of the two English Companies. Finally, in
1773, Bombay was placed in a state of dependence under the
Governor-General of Bengal, who has since been replaced by the Viceroy
of India.</p>

<p>It is from Bombay that the English have spread their influence at
present so firmly established in these territories. Simply merchants at
first, they gradually supplanted their rivals from the Portuguese and
Dutch settlements. Soon they aspired to a more solid power, and came
into direct conflict with the natives&mdash;the Mahrattas&mdash;whom
they hastened to drive from Colaba, finding their nearness troublesome.
After the first Mahratta war, which arose from the contested succession
of the Peishwa (1774), the treaty of Salbai permitted the English to
settle in Salsette, Elephanta, Karanja, Hog Island, &amp;c. (1782). The
fort of Surat was in their hands from 1759, and in 1800 the
administration of this town was made over to them by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>the Nawab, whose
descendants contented themselves with the vain title till 1842.</p>

<p>The second Mahratta war had its origin in the treaty of Bassein
(1802), by which the Peishwa accepted the subsidiary system&mdash;a
system since adopted by the English. It resulted in an accession of
territory in Gujerat and an increase of moral influence in the Court of
the Peishwas and of the Gaekwars. The interval of peace was employed in
repressing the invasions of the pirates who were infesting the Gulfs of
Cambay and Cutch.</p>

<p>In 1807 the States of Kathiawar were placed under the British
protectorate, and in 1809 the Rao of Cutch was forced to sign a treaty
by which he bound himself to help in the destruction of the pirates;
whilst, on the other hand, scarcely had the Peishwa Baji Rao been
placed on the throne by an English army when he began plotting for the
expulsion of the English from the Deccan. In 1817 he attacked the
Resident himself, Mountstuart Elphinstone, who withdrew to Kirkee,
where with a few troops he succeeded in routing the entire army of the
Peishwa. Soon after the prince submitted to Sir John Malcolm. A pension
of &pound;80,000 was secured to the Prince, but he was deprived of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>his
States, and Bombay gained in this manner the districts of Poona,
Ahmadnagar, Nasik, Kolahpoor, Belgaum, Kaladji, Dharwar, Ahmedabad, and
the Konkan. At the same time Holkar abandoned his rights over the
districts of Kandesh, and Satara fell into the hands of the English in
1848 on the death of the last descendant of the Mahratta Shivaji. In
1860 the Non-Regulation Districts<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1755src"
href="#xd0e1755">3</a> of the Panch Mahals were ceded by Scindhia, and
in 1861 the southern limits of the Presidency were still further
extended by the annexation of the northern district of Canara taken
from Madras. From this time the history of the Bombay Presidency is
free of incidents; peace reigned, even at the time of the mutiny of
1857. The local army has, however, rendered important services in
Afghanistan, Persia, Burmah, China, Aden, and Abyssinia. Entirely
occupied in administrative reforms and the welfare of the country, the
Government has attained a state of complete prosperity under such men
as Mountstuart Elphinstone, Malcolm, and Lord Reay.<a class="noteref"

<p>According to the general census of 1891<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1770src" href="#xd0e1770">5</a> the number of Parsis in India rose
to 89,904; that is, an increase of 491 over that of the 17th of
February, 1881, which gave a total of 85,397. On the 26th of February,
1891, the entire population of the Bombay Presidency, including the
Native States and Aden, formed a total of 26,960,421 inhabitants,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e1779src" href="#xd0e1779">6</a> of whom 76,774
were Parsis (39,285 males and 37,489 females). The surplus is divided
between Madras, Bengal, and the districts of the Gaekwar of Baroda,
where is to be seen among other flourishing settlements the ancient
community of Naosari. To this number must be added the Parsis of <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>China, and of
some foreign localities, and the Iranians, 9,269 in number. The exact
number of Zoroastrians scattered over the globe we thus find to be a
hundred thousand at the most!</p>

<p>We refer to the <i>Zoroastrian Calendar</i> for all information
concerning statistics, and in a special chapter (pp. 119 <i>et
seq.</i>) we find a detailed list of the population of the city and the
Presidency of Bombay.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1801src" href=
"#xd0e1801">7</a> We take from it the following table (see next page),
which gives the assessment of the population in the different centres.
Occupying the first rank we find Bombay with its 47,458 Parsis, and
Surat with 12,757; then Broach, Thana, Poona, Karachi, down to the
least of the localities, some of which stand for only a simple unit.

<p>Considering the importance of Bombay, we will quote from a paper on
it, read by Mr. B. B. Patel before the <i>Anthropological Society of
Bombay</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2333src" href="#xd0e2333">10</a>
We find there the lists of births, deaths and marriages in the city of
Bombay from 1881 to 1890. During that period of time the average of
births has risen per year to 1,450, and that of married women bearing
children to 13.293 per cent. The average of deaths has reached 1,135
(575 of the male sex, 500 of the female sex), and 92 still-born (52 of
the male sex and 40 of the female sex). The annual average of mortality
among children below the age of five years has been 469 (236 of the
male sex and 233 of the female sex); between the ages of five and ten,
27 (13 of the male sex and 14 of the female sex); between the ages of
eleven and twenty, 47 (20 of the male sex and 27 of the female sex);
between the ages of twenty-one and thirty, 65, in the proportion of 27
to 38 for the two sexes; between the ages of thirty-one and forty, 62,
in equal proportions for the two sexes; between the ages of forty-one
and sixty, 177 (67 males and 90 females). Above the age of eighty the
average reaches 37, of whom 13 are males and 24 females. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87">87</a>]</span></p>

<p>During these ten years, four persons have died at the age of 100,
two at the ages of 101 and 105, and lastly one at the age of 110 years.
These centenarians have been all women. The principal cause of
mortality among Parsis is fever (Table D); thus of 1,135 deaths, 293
may be attributed to it, 150 to nervous disorders, 91 to affections of
the respiratory organs, 70 to dysentery, 38 to phthisis, one hundred to
old age, and the rest to diverse other causes, such as measles,
pleurisy, diarrh&oelig;a, &amp;c., &amp;c. According to the table drawn
up by Mr. Patel (Table E), the highest rate of mortality in Bombay is
in the Fort, and next to it in Dhobitalao, Baherkote, Khetwady,
&amp;c., in proportion to the population of these localities.</p>

<p>After the crisis of 1865 a serious decrease of the population in
Bombay had been apprehended for a time; but it was an exaggerated fear
which disappeared with the census of 1881. It has been proved, on the
contrary, that the conditions of life among the Parsis, both as regards
mortality and hygiene, have reduced the average of mortality among the
individuals, grown-up men, women and children. These latter,
well-tended and carefully brought up, supply a splendid race,
susceptible of culture, and endowed with perfect health. Accordingly,
from 1872 to 1881, the Parsi population <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>has increased nearly ten per cent.
This increase has continued, and, as we have said, the highest increase
has been estimated in 1891 to be 4.91.</p>

<p>It is in vain that communities of Parsis have been sought for
outside those regions which we have indicated.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e2348src" href="#xd0e2348">11</a> About sixty years ago a Mahomedan
traveller did try to persuade others of the existence of a Parsi colony
at Khoten, a country situated to the south-east of Kaschgar; but Sir
Alexander Burnes, in a communication to Mr. Naoroji Fardunji,
dissipated this illusion.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2354src" href=
"#xd0e2354">12</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href=
"#pb89">89</a>]</span></p>

<p>We cannot attach any more importance to an assertion recently put
forward, and according to which the members of the tribe of the
Shiaposch Kafirs, inhabiting the country to the north-east of Cabul,
are descendants of the same race, because certain of their usages, as
for example their manner of exposing their dead, are similar to those
of the Zoroastrians. Sir Alexander Burnes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e2365src" href="#xd0e2365">13</a> in narrating his travels in Cabul
in 1836&ndash;37&ndash;38, relates that the most curious of all the
visitors to the country of the Kafirs<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e2371src" href="#xd0e2371">14</a> was a man who came from Cabul
towards the year 1829. He gave himself out as a Guebre
(fire-worshipper), and an Ibrahumi (follower of Abraham), who had
quitted Persia to find some traces of his ancestors. During his sojourn
in Cabul he willingly mixed with the Armenians and used to get himself
called Sheryar, a name common enough among the modern Parsis. They
tried, but in vain, to dissuade him from risking himself amongst the
Kafirs; he went to Jalalabad and Lughman, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb90" href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>where he left his baggage, and as a
simple beggar entered Kafristan by way of Nujjeet. He was absent
several months, and on his return was assassinated by the Huzaras of
the tribe of Ali-Purast. Malik-Usman, furious at the conduct of his
countrymen, exacted a fine of Rs. 2,000 as compensation for the blood
shed by them. All these details were given by the Armenians of Cabul to
Sir Alexander Burnes, but he could not discover whether the unfortunate
Sheryar was a Parsi of Bombay or a Guebre of Kirman. However, a
document found in the possession of the traveller, and coming from the
Shah of Persia, leads us to believe that the latter hypothesis is the
true one.</p>

<p>The Census of 1881 enables us to state some interesting facts, which
give us an idea of the occupations of the Parsis of Bombay, and of the
kind of life led by them. Thus there were at that time 855 priests and
persons devoted to religion, 141 teachers, 34 school-mistresses, 33
engineers, 1,384 clerks, and 115 <span class="corr" id="xd0e2381"
title="Source: employes">employees</span>. Naval construction seemed to
be one of their favourite occupations, for out of 46 ship-builders 26
were Parsis. As for the Dubashes or ship-brokers, out of a total of
159, 146 were Parsis. All professions and manual trades were largely
represented, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91">91</a>]</span>the exception of that of tailor, which was
exercised by only one member of the community. At one time, out of
9,584 beggars in the town of Bombay, there were only five Parsis and
one Parsi woman. As to the class of the unfortunate victims of vice and
debauchery, a Parsi has not hesitated to affirm that <i>not one</i> of
his co-religionists could have been accused of living on the wages of
shame.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2389src" href="#xd0e2389">15</a>
Travellers have made the same remarks. Thus, according to Mandelslo,
adultery and lewdness were considered by the Parsis as the greatest
sins they could commit, and which they would doubtless have punished
with death if they themselves had the administration of justice (see
<i>Voyages</i>, &amp;c., trans. Wicquefort, p. 184). We may state in
this connection that Anquetil gives a precise account of a summary
execution under the sanction of the Punchayet, and with the approbation
of the Mahomedan governor of Bharooch (see <i>Zend-Avesta</i>, vol. ii.
p. 606); and Stavorinus, at the end of the century, makes mention of
Parsi women who had been preserved in the right path by the fear of
punishment (see <i>Voyages</i>, &amp;c., vol. I, ch. xxviii. p. 363).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92">92</a>]</span></p>

<p>The following is a division, under seven heads, of the occupations
of the Parsis, as shown in the census of 1881:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is some reason for not wondering at the disinclination of the
Parsis for agriculture and the profession of arms. Agriculture had been
very flourishing in the hands of the first colonists; but tastes
changed, and from men of the field they became men of the town. At the
beginning of the century some of them were still in possession of vast
tracts of land, and spent much money in improving them. But these
gradually passed into other hands, a circumstance in any case greatly
to be regretted.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2470src" href=
"#xd0e2470">17</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93">93</a>]</span></p>

<p>As to their apparent repugnance for military service we will see
what an enlightened Parsi, who has in this case made himself the
spokesman of his co-religionists, has to say. As a matter of fact, the
Persians in olden times had distinguished themselves amongst all by
their valour and courage. In the inscription engraved on his tomb at
Nakch-i-Roustam, King Darius might well say, with a just feeling of
pride, that they had only to look at the images of those who supported
his throne to know into what distant places the Persian soldier had
carried his arms! The famous struggles maintained by the Ardeshirs, the
Shapoors, and the Noshirvans show that this warlike temper had not
subsided. Why then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href=
"#pb94">94</a>]</span>should the descendants of such heroes abstain
from taking part in military exercises and in defending the country<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e2489src" href="#xd0e2489">18</a>?</p>

<p>Mr. Dosabhai Framji Karaka gives the following explanation of this
aversion.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2505src" href="#xd0e2505">19</a> In
the first place he indignantly repudiates the theory put forward by
certain European authors that it proceeds purely from religious
motives, on account of the worship they are supposed to pay to fire,
which would prevent them from handling a cannon or shouldering a gun.
Nothing at all in fact prevents them from making use of fire in the
handling of offensive and defensive weapons. At the time of certain
riots in Bombay, gunsmiths&rsquo; shops were seen to be rapidly emptied
by the Parsis, and thirty-five years back they were enthusiastic in
joining the first volunteer movement; but in 1877 only Europeans were
invited to join. Still, protests Mr. D. F. Karaka, there are certainly
no natives more eager than the Parsis to share in the defence of
British interests. In several places they have joined the volunteers
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>and have
obtained much-envied distinctions.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2515src"
href="#xd0e2515">20</a> They are able to attain a high degree of skill
in the handling of firearms; for example, Mr. Dorabji Padamji, son of
the late Khan Bahadur Padamji Pestonji, is one of the best shots in
India.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2518src" href="#xd0e2518">21</a></p>

<p>The most serious consideration which prevents a Parsi from enrolling
himself in the army seems therefore, to us, to be the insufficiency of
the pay. We only repeat it: it is a Parsee who says this. We have no
desire either to weaken their motives or to exaggerate their
grievances. We are well aware that these are very delicate questions,
and require to be treated with care and skill, since they concern the
relations of devoted subjects with a government of which they are
proud. On <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96">96</a>]</span>the other hand, when we take into consideration
the moral worth and intelligent co-operation which the Parsis bring to
the service of this same government, we are not at all surprised at the
conclusion which we see so clearly formulated.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e2525src" href="#xd0e2525">22</a></p>

<p>Native soldiers, whether Hindoos or Mussulmans, are paid at the rate
of seven rupees a month, about fourteen shillings (17 fr. 50 c.),
including rations, while a Parsi filling the most modest employment of
a cook or a servant earns double that sum. During certain disturbances
when Bombay was deprived of its European troops, many Parsis would
willingly have enrolled themselves in the army if they had been given
the pay of European soldiers. It is a matter of regret to them, perhaps
a sort of degradation of which they feel the keenness, at being obliged
to put forward pecuniary considerations; but their mode of life, even
that of the poorest among them, cannot be compared with that of Hindoos
and Mussalmans of the same <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=
"#pb97">97</a>]</span>class. These can live on seven rupees a month;
Hindoos and Mahomedans of the same family are content with one room, a
thing which the humblest Parsi would never allow. The Hindoo or
Mussulman woman hardly requires more than one or two <i>saris</i>,
costing about three rupees, to clothe herself, and her children can go
naked till the age of ten years. But as for the Parsi woman she
requires several <i>saris</i>, trousers, shirts and slippers, besides
suitable clothing for her children. How can a Parsi soldier then manage
to live and bring up his family on seven rupees a month?</p>

<p>Mr. Karaka ends his long and eloquent appeal with a sentence which
sounds the true keynote of the regret felt by the Parsis at being
merely compared with the natives when they felt themselves to be
morally and intellectually their superiors. Why are they not provided
with commissions in the army like the Germans and other Europeans?<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e2543src" href="#xd0e2543">23</a> Then only will
they feel completely identified with the British nation.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e2549src" href="#xd0e2549">24</a> <span class=

<p>The Parsis in India are divided into two sects, the Shahanshahis and
the Kadmis.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2557src" href="#xd0e2557">25</a>
When Anquetil Duperron visited India this division already existed, and
he found them &ldquo;more excited against each other than the Mahomedan
sects of Omar and Ali.&rdquo; The Parsis, however, do not admit this.
This division has nothing to do with their faith, and has nothing in
common with the division between the Shiahs and the Sunnis. The
schism<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2569src" href="#xd0e2569">26</a> has
arisen simply out of a difference of opinion concerning the exact date
of computation of the era of Yezdezard, the last king of the ancient
Persian monarchy. This division does not exist amongst the Zoroastrians
who have remained behind in their own country. <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99">99</a>]</span></p>

<p>The Parsis reckon their year on a calculation of three hundred and
sixty-five days, each month consisting of thirty days. Their year
commences with the month of <i>Farvardin</i>, and ends with the month
of <i>Spendarmad</i>. At the end of three hundred and sixty days, five
days, called the <i>Gathas</i> are added. The period of five hours and
fifty-four seconds does not enter into their computation. The old
Persians, therefore, in order to make their calculation agree with the
solar year, had made at the end of every hundred and twenty years an
intercalation or <i>Kabisa</i>, that is to say, they added one month to
that period. The Persian Zoroastrians, after the loss of their
independence, either through ignorance or simple forgetfulness, had
ceased to practise this <i>Kabisa</i>, whilst the Parsis had continued
this intercalation during their residence in Khorassan. Hence the
origin of the sects with which we have to deal.</p>

<p>In 1720<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2610src" href="#xd0e2610">27</a>
Jamasp Vilayati, a learned Zoroastrian <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>from Persia, settled in Surat to
advise the Mobeds, and it was he who discovered that his
co-religionists of India were one month behind their Iranian brethren.
Little importance however <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101">101</a>]</span>was attached to this fact. But in 1746 another
Iranian, Jamshed, and some Mobeds adopted the date accepted by the
Persian Zoroastrians, and took the name of Kadmis. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>The rest of the
community were called Shahanshahis, and preserved the ancient system.
Little by little the number of the adherents of Jamshed increased. Now
it should be noticed that it was in Surat that this schism among the
Parsis first took place, and for some time the harmonious relations
between the two did not suffer by it. But two respectable men,
Mancherji Kharshedji Seth, of the Shahanshahi sect, and Dhanjisha
Manjisha, of the Kadmi sect, managed literally to ignite the powder in
spite of their benevolent intentions. In order to get some
enlightenment Dhanjisha Manjisha sent to Persia at his own expense a
priest from Bharooch, Kavas Rustam Jalal. Born at Bharooch in 1733,
this man was well versed in the Arabic and Persian languages. For
twelve years he remained in Persia and Turkey, visited Yezd, Ispahan,
Shiraz, and Constantinople, and returned to Surat in 1780. During his
sojourn in Persia he had obtained an audience with Kerim Khan. Some
months before his return Dhanjisha Manjisha had come to Bombay, and had
there founded the Kadmi sect under the auspices of Dadiseth, one of the
most influential men of the time. Mulla Kavas followed his patron to
Bombay and was appointed Dastoor of the Atash-Behram erected <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>by Dadiseth
himself (Dadibhai Nasarwanji) for the Kadmi sect, which he consecrated
on the 29th of September, 1783. The following year he quitted Bombay
and settled in Hyderabad, in the Deccan, where he was honoured with the
friendship of the Nizam. He remained there till his death, which took
place in 1802 (<i>Parsee Pr&acirc;k&acirc;sh</i>, p. 92).</p>

<p>The Kadmi sect continued to flourish in Bombay, when, at the
commencement of the century, rose the great dispute of the <i>
Kabisa</i>, that is to say, the famous month by which the Kadmis were
in advance of the Shahanshahis (<i>Parsee Pr&acirc;k&acirc;sh</i>, pp.
62, 198, 863, 867, &amp;c.). Mulla Firoz,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e2677src" href="#xd0e2677">29</a> son of Mulla Kavas, and another
distinguished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href=
"#pb104">104</a>]</span>priest, Fardunji Marazbanji, constituted
themselves the champions of the Kadmi sect, while the mass of the
people, guided by Kharshedji Manockji Shroff, grouped themselves under
the patronage of the pious Dastoor of the Shahanshahis, Edulji Dorabji
Sanjana,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2711src" href="#xd0e2711">30</a> and
clung to the date observed by the Parsis since their arrival in India.
Meetings were organised to which learned Moguls were invited, in order
to offer explanations, and, if possible, to terminate the discussion.
The newspapers were full of virulent articles, pamphlets appeared in
great numbers, and the people in some cases seemed disposed to settle
the question by the right of might, an irrefutable argument.</p>

<p>The Shahanshahis maintained that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb105" href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>Zoroastrian religion admitted a
month&rsquo;s intercalation at the end of a period of 120 years, and
that at the time of the fall of the Persian Empire there had indeed
been <i>one</i> intercalation during their sojourn in Khorassan, but
once they were in India this usage had been abandoned; hence the
backwardness by one month from the computation of the Kadmis. The
latter declared on the other hand that the intercalation was forbidden
in the Zoroastrian calendar, that it was only meant for political
emergencies, and that this mode of calculation had never been practised
in Khorassan.</p>

<p>Modern learning has brought this vexed question within its true
limits. Mr. Kharshedji Rustamji Kama, of the Kadmi sect, known by his
study of the Zoroastrian religion, has proved, or rather has attempted
to prove, in a work on the computation of Yezdezard, that the
Shahanshahis and the Kadmis were both in error (1870). The Kadmis were
wrong in denying that the Parsee new year commenced on the 21st of
March, for from a more exact knowledge of the language of the <i>
Avesta</i>, and the deciphering of Pehlvi coins, it is demonstrated
that the Zoroastrian religion admitted the intercalation; and the
Shahanshahis were equally wrong, for, since the downfall of the <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>Persian
Empire, there had been no intercalation as they affirmed. The opinion
of the Kadmis, in accordance with the date accepted by the Zoroastrians
of Persia, which proves that there had been no intercalation after the
fall of the national dynasty, is absolutely correct; but as the
intercalation was not ordered by the Zoroastrian religion, it appears
that both sides were wrong in the controversy of the <i>Kabisa</i>.</p>

<p>The greatest disputes had arisen from this religious quarrel; scenes
of surprising violence had resulted from it. For instance, in Bharooch
(1782&ndash;1783) a certain Homaji Jamshedji had struck a pregnant
woman and been condemned to death; others got off with mere fines. In
the heat of the disputes families became divided; marriages between
Kadmis and Shahanshahis were very rare.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e2745src" href="#xd0e2745">31</a> At present most of the
difficulties have been smoothed down. It happens sometimes that the
husband and wife belong to different sects; in that case the children
invariably belong to the father&rsquo;s sect. There are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>no appreciable
differences, the pronunciation alone being at times not quite the same.
Thus <i>Ahu, Vohu</i>, is pronounced <i>Ah&icirc;, Voh&icirc;</i> among
the Kadmis. There is also some difference in certain religious
ceremonies, and in certain liturgical formulas. But the greatest
divergence is in the mention of the month and the date of the day when
the worshipper is reciting his prayers. All the feasts are observed by
both the sects, but at different dates.</p>

<p>The Shahanshahis are greatly superior in numbers to the Kadmis.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e2758src" href="#xd0e2758">32</a> The latter can
hardly count more than ten to fifteen thousand adherents. Many of them
occupy the highest position. Mr. F. N. Patel, the members of the Cama,
Dadiseth, and Banaji families, &amp;c., are among them. The
Shahanshahis are represented by Sir Jamshedji Jijibhoy, Sir Dinsha
Manockji Petit, and many other not less respectable names. <span class=

<p>The Parsis, at the time of their arrival in India, had made some
changes in their national costume with a view to please the princes who

you that it is a legend devoid of foundation, and that Major Rawlinson,
so learned in these matters, partakes of my view. I suppose that the
Syed, seeing the prosperous condition of his co-religionists in Bombay,
imagined that in flattering your vanity he would act on your purse.
Besides, the country of Khoten is not the <i>terra incognita</i> which
he has depicted. I have been in touch with the people who have
sojourned there; it is a dependency of China, inhabited by Mussulman
subjects of the Empire: the only Chinese who are there form part of the
garrison. According to all that has been said to me of Khoten and the

from the chief of Rajpipla, a great stretch of land in the

outstripped by Kavasji Framji Banaji in his beautiful domain of Pawai.
Lord Mayo has highly recognised the great importance of agricultural
studies, and in 1870 he declared that the progress of India in riches
and in civilisation depended on the progress of agriculture. See

"noteref" id="xd0e2613src" href="#xd0e2613">28</a> &ldquo;About
forty-six years ago there came from Kirman a very clever Dastoor named
Djamasp. He had been sent to re-unite the Parsis divided on the
question of the <i>Penom</i>, a double piece of cloth with which the
Parsis, on certain occasions, cover a part of the face. Some wished
that it should be placed on the dead, others did not like this. Djamasp
decided in favour of the latter, according to the custom of Kirman. If
this Dastoor had not made the voyage to India, this frivolous contest
would have caused streams of blood to flow.</p>

<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Djamasp is believed to have examined the <i>
Vendidad</i>, which was current in Gujerat. He found the Pehlvi
translation of it too long and not correct in several places. Ignorance
was the predominating vice of the Parsis of India. In order to remedy
it, the Dastoor of Kirman formed some disciples, Darab at Surat,
Djamasp at Naosari, and a third at Bharooch, to whom he taught Zend and
Pehlvi. Some time after, tired of the contradictions which he had to
endure, he returned to Kirman. The books which this Dastoor has left in
India are an exact copy of the Zend and Pehlvi <i>Vendidad</i>, the <i>
Feroueschi</i>, the translation of the <i>Vadjerguerd</i>, and the <i>
Nerenguestan</i>. These two works are in Persian, mixed with Zend, and
purely on ceremonials.</p>

<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Darab, the first disciple of Djamasp, and a
Dastoor Mobed perfect in the knowledge of Zend and Pehlvi, wished to
correct the Pehlvi translation of the <i>Vendidad</i> and rectify some
portions of the Zend Text, which appeared to him either to have been
transposed or to present useless repetitions. He began explaining to
young Parsi theologians the works of Zoroaster, which the Mobeds read
every day without understanding them. An enslaved people who for a long
time practised a thousand ceremonies, the sense and reason of which
they were ignorant of, would naturally fall into innumerable abuses.
This was what Darab, more learned than the others, observed. The
purifications were multiplied; the Zend text was inundated with Pehlvi
commentaries, often very inconsistent. Darab at first attempted the way
of instruction. But he found a powerful adversary in the person of
Manscherdji, the chief of the party who did not like reform, and
himself the son of a Mobed.</p>

<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Another subject of division animated them
again, one against the other. Darab had for his father Kaous, of whom I
have spoken before, who had received from Dastoor Djamasp the first
smatterings of astronomy, according to the principles of Oulough Beg.
This Dastoor Mobed having been perfected since then under another Parsi
come from Kirman about thirty-six years ago, showed by the Tables of
Oulough Beg that the <i>Nao rouz</i> (the first day of the year) ought
to be advanced by a month, and that consequently there had been an
error till then. A letter of the Dastoors of Yezd, dated the 22nd of
the month Aban, of the year 1111 of Yezdezard (1742, <span class=
"smallcaps">A.D.</span>) and brought by the Parsi Espendiar, confirmed
the discovery of Kaous, but did not tend to protect him from the hatred
of his compatriots. It went so far that Darab, sixteen or seventeen
years ago, was obliged to withdraw to Damann amongst the Portuguese,
and Kaous to Cambay among the English. When I arrived at Surat, almost
all the Parsis of India followed the party of Manscherdji because he
was rich and powerful; Darab, whose knowledge was recognised even by
his adversaries, had some disciples who, in the sequel, showed
themselves more freely when the authority of Manscherdji had been
lowered at Surat with that of the Dutch, whose agent he was.&rdquo;</p>

father Mulla Kavas as Dastoor of the Kadmis (1802); when hardly eight
years old he had accompanied Mulla Kavas to Persia and had learned
Persian and Arabic. In 1786 he wrote in Persian a curious recital of
his voyage, <i>Derich Kherde Manjumi</i>. In 1830 he published the <i>
Avij&eacute;h Din</i> to refute the arguments of Dastoor Edalji Dorabji
Sanjana. The governor of Bombay, Mr. Jonathan Duncan, engaged him to
teach Persian, and to translate the <i>Desatir</i>. Mr. Duncan having
died, Mulla Firoz continued his work in concert with Mr. William
Erskine, and finished it in 1819. He died in 1830 (<i>Parsee
Pr&acirc;k&acirc;sh</i>, p. 229) and bequeathed his collection of books
in Zend, Pehlvi, &amp;c., to the Kadmi community; the library which
contains them is situate in &ldquo;Fort,&rdquo; and bears his name. We
owe to Mulla Firoz a poem on the conquest of India by the English, the
<i>George Namah</i>, which was terminated and published in 1837 by his
nephew and successor, Dastoor Rastamji Kaikobadji. On the death of the
latter (1854) (<i>Parsee Pr&acirc;k&acirc;sh</i>, p. 635), the Kadmis
combined to found a <i>madressa</i> which they called <i>Mulla
Firoz</i> (<i>Parsee Pr&acirc;k&acirc;sh</i>, p. 647).</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=
"#xd0e2711src" id="xd0e2711">30</a></span> Edalji Dorabji Sanjana was
esteemed for his piety and merits. He was in his time one of the first
<i>savants</i> in Zend and Pehlvi; he was equally perfect in Sanscrit.
We owe to him several works on the Mazdiene religion, amongst others a
book entitled <i>Khorehe Vehijak</i>, which brought forth in reply the
<i>Avij&eacute;h Din</i> of Mulla Firoz. He died in 1847 (<i>Parsee
Pr&acirc;k&acirc;sh</i>, p. 495).</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=
"#xd0e2745src" id="xd0e2745">31</a></span> Most offensive epithets were
interchanged between Kadmis and Shahanshahis, such as that of churigar
(&ldquo;churi,&rdquo; bracelets, bangles; and &ldquo;gar,&rdquo;
workman) a term of contempt carrying with it an idea of weakness; the
children of the two sects pursued one another in the streets, insulting
one another. This was hardly fifty years ago.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href=
"#xd0e2758src" id="xd0e2758">32</a></span> The sect of the Shahanshahis
possesses in Bombay two High Priests&mdash;Dastoor Jamaspji Minocherji
and Shams ul ulma Dastoor Peshotan Behramji Sanjana; at Poona there is
only one, Dastoor Hoshangji Jamaspji. The sect of the Kadmis has also
High Priests&mdash;Dastoor Kharshedji Phirozji Mulla Firoz, elected by
the whole community, who is attached to the Dadiseth Atash-Behram, and
Dastoor Kharshedji Bezonji, attached to the Framji Kavasji Banaji
Atash-Behram.</p>
